<p><em>2/11/2014</em></p>
<!-- It's all about love Part 2 -->

<p>Here is the recap from our last meeting, where we discussed how love is (or should be) the center of all that we do.</p>
<p>We started out with a transition from our previous discussion, where we described God's love not only being toward you, but that it is also in you.  We aren't just recipients of God's love (that is who we are), we are replicators and conduits of God's love (that is what we do).</p>
<h2 id="three-parts-of-love">Three parts of love</h2>
<p>I accidentally skipped a clip, so I will summarize what was in that clip here:</p>
<p>There are 3 parts to God's love: 
<em> His love flowing to us
</em> His love dwelling in us
* His love flowing through us.  </p>
<p>Those 3 parts must be together - you can't separate them.  Because of His love in us, there should be 3 results in our life: We reflect that love back to God (worship), we affirm our own worth in God, and we affirm the worth of others.  These three things are inseparable as well - you can't do one without doing the others.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anyone says they love God but don't love their neighbor, they are a liar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A side note on affirming your own worth in God:  The Bible is not against self-love.  Love your neighbor as <strong>yourself</strong>.  You affirm the worth you have because of who God is.</p>
<h2 id="the-greatest-commandment">The greatest commandment</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A36-39&amp;version=NASB">Matthew 22:36-39</a> - when someone asked Jesus what the greatest commandment was, Jesus gave 2 commandments, because you can't do one without the other.  Love God with all your heart AND love your neighbor as yourself.  This is the central thing the Christian life is supposed to be about.</p>
<h2 id="above-all">Above all</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A21&amp;version=NASB">1 John 4:21</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+16%3A14&amp;version=NASB">1 Corinthians 16:14</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let all that you do be done in love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A14a&amp;version=NASB">Colossians 3:14a</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond all these things put on love</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+4%3A8&amp;version=NASB">1 Peter 4:8</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A14&amp;version=NASB">Galatians 5:14</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="an-analogy">An analogy</h2>
<p>The analogy we heard was to think about clothing yourself with love like you would wear clothes.  None of us would go to work, church, school, the store, etc without wearing our clothes.  We don't even have to think about it, right?  "Wearing" love should be just like that.<br />
We don't have to wonder, "Should I be loving in this situation?" - the answer is always yes!  </p>
<p>This is a given: <strong>love continually.</strong></p>
<h2 id="love-continually">Love continually</h2>
<p>We also talked about that if we can do this (love all the time), everything else will fall into place.  Gossip, stealing, etc - if your goal is to love others ALL the time, it will be impossible to gossip, steal, etc.  Love all the time, and everything falls into place, but the opposite is true: don't love all the time, and you will struggle with all the other things.</p>
<h2 id="anything-without-love-is-worthless">Anything without love is worthless</h2>
<p>This sounds really harsh.  But look at the familiar passage of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A1-3&amp;version=NASB">1 Corinthians 13:1-3</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.</p>
<p>If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. </p>
<p>And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is what Paul says about your actions if they are not backed up with love - your actions are: A noisy gong, a clanging symbol, worth nothing.</p>
<p>All of those actions can be great, and they may look really good, but if they aren't founded in love, they are nothing.</p>
<h2 id="actions-without-love-can-be-dangerous">Actions without love can be dangerous</h2>
<p>We discussed how sometimes Christians or churches can put certain principles or actions above love.  These things can look very good, but if they aren't done in love, they can be evil.  </p>
<p>This is not saying to ignore any parts of the Bible that don't deal with love - but if you take things from the Bible and put them above love, you use it loving some of the time (when people agree with you), but it also can be used to hurt (especially when people don't agree with you).  </p>
<p>Even the devil can quote the Bible, but he doesn't do it in love.</p>
<h2 id="our-small-group">Our small group</h2>
<p>We also heard how a church can have the best programs, give the best sermons, have the best music, but if the end product isn't people who live in an outrageous, radical, ridiculous love, all of those good things aren't worth it.  </p>
<p>I related this to our group.  I desperately want our group to be founded in love so that as we go out from our group, God's love is carried out to those around us - maybe not even intentionally, but that people around us would constantly be affected by God's love flowing through us.</p>
<h2 id="stay-awake">Stay awake</h2>
<p>Stay awake to the love God has given you.  As you live your life and encounter people, ask this question to yourself about every person you are around: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can I affirm the infinite worth of this person for whom Christ died?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This person has infinite value to God!</em></p>
<h2 id="differing-situations">Differing situations</h2>
<p>Sharing love with people will look different in each situation:  You will show love to your kids differently than you would show love to someone at the store.  </p>
<p>And as we discussed, maybe it isn't even about an action.  You don't necessarily need to go out of your way to give love to every person around you.  Maybe when everyone is giving a smoker a dirty look when they walk by, you smile at them.  When everyone is staring at the parent of the kid throwing a tantrum, maybe you just go about your business like nothing is bothering you.  That simple act of not judging them can be showing love to them.</p>
<p>The point is: you can always show love, and you should never not show love (see all the verses above).  </p>
<h2 id="tough-situations">Tough situations</h2>
<p>We had discussion about how sometimes it can require God's wisdom on how to show love in certain situations: discipline, being a manager of employees, etc. </p>
<p>Sometimes it can feel unloving to correct someone, but just think about them as being infinitely loved by God, and think about how you can correct someone in a loving manner.  In a few weeks, we will go into this in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="when-we-dont-live-in-love">When we don't live in love</h2>
<p>This whole discussion was centered around love, and how God commands us, above all things, all the time to Love.  </p>
<p>When I actually think about this as a command from God, and then think about how often I have not done this, I realize how often I have disobeyed God's greatest commandment...  </p>
<p>The redeeming part of this, though, is that God saved us with His grace, and he still pours his outrageous love on us, just waiting for us to share it with others.</p>
<h2 id="a-challenge">A challenge</h2>
<p>Think of one person that you know you don't show love.  Maybe you don't hate them, but you definitely haven't ascribed to them the infinite worth they have in God.  </p>
<p>Pray that God would help you speak, act, and think about this person in love.  </p>
<p>Maybe you still feel yucky about them - maybe they have hurt you... but like the verse above, love is so powerful it can cover a multitude of sins.  Also pray for forgiveness for all the times you did not love this person.</p>
<h2 id="my-personal-challenge">My personal challenge</h2>
<p>We didn't discuss this on Sunday, but I would like to take this a step further.  I would like to issue myself a personal challenge:  When I see how incredibly important it is for us to live in love, and how everything we do must be done in love, I want to change the way I live.  This is going to be my focus during this series we are doing as a small group, and I am praying my life will be changed as a result.  </p>
<p>I want my life to change to the point where love becomes so embedded that I don't even have to think intentionally about loving someone.  I want to clothe myself in love.  I commit to you guys that I will work on being more intentional about living in love.  I know it will be hard at first and I know I will fail, but I can't wait until it is a natural part of my daily life.  </p>
<p>As my closest group of spiritual friends, I give you permission to keep me accountable, and to challenge me when you see me not acting in a way that is loving.</p>
<p>I'm not sharing this challenge to force you into anything.  Like I shared on Sunday, my prayer and vision for the group is that we become a group of love, where love comes pouring out of us.  This personal challenge is the first step for me.</p>
<p>My intent in sharing my personal challenge is to look to you guys for support and to encourage you guys to always be growing.  </p>
<p>Be honest with God and stretch yourself to grow a little bit at a time.  If you feel like God is laying an area on your heart where you could grow, and want accountability, what better group of people than our small group to share it with and ask for help.  </p>
<p>Only you know where you stand with God, and maybe you need to just dwell on the first two lessons we covered about knowing your name in Christ, and learning more about how God loves you.  </p>
<p>Maybe you are already really good at loving those around you and you can be a support for the rest of the group.</p>
