<p><em>4/18/2014</em></p>
<!-- -->

<p>God bless you on this Good Friday.  In preparing this recap, I feel it really goes along well with the Easter season.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed our discussion on Sunday.  I know the sermon clips were a bit shorter this time, but the discussion we had was great. </p>
<h2 id="my-background">My Background</h2>
<p>As I shared on Sunday, when I originally heard this sermon it really touched me because of my shallow relationship with God.  I was nearly perfect on the outside, but as the sermon showed - the outward actions aren't what bring you closer to God.  </p>
<p>When we have an honest relationship with God, the outward actions are a result.  I was using my knowledge of good and evil to dictate how I lived my life instead of living in a relationship with God.</p>
<h2 id="the-knowledge-of-good-and-evil">The knowledge of good and evil</h2>
<p>We heard in the sermon how when you live in that knowledge of good and evil, you constantly evaluate each situation to know how to respond: What would be the Christian thing to say, what would be the godly way to respond, what's the exact "right" prayer I should pray at this point, etc.  </p>
<p>Your life and your worth hang on your ability to perform "correctly".  Technically, this type of behavior looks good and right, but there is a quality of life missing, a joy that is missing, a freedom that is missing when people live this way rather than out of a relationship with God.</p>
<p>There was a story in the sermon that illustrated this perfectly (it was just way too long to include on Sunday).  I will send the story next week.</p>
<p>People who live this way (like I was) think that living religiously <em>is</em> the relationship with God, but it isn't.  Because they are so wrapped up in correct behavior, when they don't exhibit correct behavior, they feel indicted, and compensate by minimizing their own sin, and trying to maximize the sins of the people around them.  </p>
<p>Because they get life from their system of right-ness, it looks like they have a relationship with God - but in fact, they are hiding behind a wall they create, which prevents them from actually having a good relationship with God.  They hide, just like Adam and Eve did after eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<h2 id="god-loves-you-anyways">God loves you anyways</h2>
<p>We then heard how all of this type of behavior is a result of not trusting God.  Not trusting that God is big enough to love you <em>as you are</em>.  Not trusting that God truly loves the people around you.  But what God wants us to see is the truth of He is, revealed in the cross of Jesus.</p>
<p>God wants you because He is in love with you and Jesus died for you - not a perfect you, not a technically correct you, but the real you.</p>
<h2 id="no-more-performing">No more performing</h2>
<p>Quit evaluating yourself and others - that's the curse of the forbidden tree.  Get out of your performing and get into a relationship with God.  Own up to who you are:  You are guilty - but Jesus died for you <em>as you are</em> and wants to love you and heal you.  Actually, you are even more guilty than you think you are, but He still loves you anyways.  </p>
<p>Plus, God knows you better than you know yourself:  Do you think he doesn't know what you have done or how you are living?  But Jesus dieing on the cross is a testimony of how much God loves you.  </p>
<p><em>Remember our study a couple of months ago about how much God loves you?  He gave everything - he couldn't have given anything more - to show you how much He loves you.</em></p>
<h2 id="honesty">Honesty</h2>
<p>Will you trust God enough to be honest with Him?  Give Him your heart - don't justify or excuse it - admit it because Jesus has already <em>experienced</em> every sin you have committed as He hung on the cross.  He loves you anyways, and died for you <em>just as you are</em>.  His mercy is <em>far</em> bigger than any of your sins.  </p>
<p>If you doubt this, let the nail marks in his hands and His pierced sides be proof to you.  Let His cries of grief as he took your sin upon Himself be proof to you that His mercy is bigger than those sins.  He is safe - be honest and real with Him.  </p>
<p>Once you do this, you can begin to discover the kind of love that God is and let Him change you from the inside out.</p>
<h2 id="jesus-as-our-defender">Jesus as our defender</h2>
<p>We then heard the analogy of a defense lawyer.  We are guilty of our sins, but Jesus is our defense lawyer </p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A1-2&amp;version=NIV">1 John 2:1-2</a> (NIV): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus, the defense lawyer, has never lost a case - every single person He represents is found to be innocent (Isaiah 1:18 NIV: "Come now, let us settle the matter,” says the Lord. “Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.")</p>
<p>In fact, every person is not only found to be innocent, but also comes back as already "serving the time" for their actions - the punishment is already complete. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A21&amp;version=NASB">2 Corinthians 5:21</a> (NIV): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus does this by being outrageously loving - he has a love relationship with you, the defendant.  It turns out that Jesus is also the judge on the case.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A10&amp;version=NASB">2 Corinthians 5:10</a> (NIV): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is how He wins every case.  </p>
<p>The point of the analogy was not to relate Jesus to a legal trial, although it illustrates it well.  </p>
<p>The point is how much Jesus loves you.  </p>
<p>He doesn't want you to try to be something you are not.  Go to Him as you are.  Be honest with Him, and don't hide from Him like Adam and Eve did.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Once you "give in" to Him, you begin to discover your relationship with Him is not centered on what you are <em>doing</em>, but it is centered on your <em>being</em>.  </p>
<p>When you let God love you this way, you begin to be transformed from the inside out.  You begin to do the right things out of God's love, not out of an obligation of how you are "supposed" to act.</p>
<p>It's all about the infinite love of God toward you - the infinite worth God ascribes to you. Live in that - get your life from that.  Stop getting your life from behaving the "right" way.</p>
<p>I'll leave with a quote from one of the clips we heard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus died on the cursed tree to free you from the curse of the forbidden tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a great Easter weekend - He is risen indeed!</p>
