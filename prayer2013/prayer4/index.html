                <h1 id="prayer-4">Prayer #4</h1>
<p><em>11/7/2013</em></p>
<h2 id="quick-summary">Quick summary:</h2>
<p>Using your imagination while praying can make your prayer time more passionate and align you with God's heart because it gives you a picture in your mind of the reality of what you are praying for.</p>
<h2 id="seeing">Seeing</h2>
<p>We learned that the Hebrew word for dream and vision are the same word - it basically describes a kind of "seeing" that takes place in our mind.  We talked about <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+3%3A14-18&amp;version=NASB">2 Corinthians 3:14-18</a> where Paul describes this type of seeing, and uses the analogy of our mind being like a mirror in which we can "see" God.  "Seeing" God this way eventually transforms us: When we imagine God's love for us, it makes us more loving; when we imagine God's joy over us, it makes us more joyful.</p>
<h2 id="reality">Reality</h2>
<p>We also learned that satan doesn't want us to use our imagination this way - a good example is how today people mostly associate your imagination with fantasy - creating images in your mind that are not real to escape reality.  We talked about how imagination can actually bring you closer to reality:  Describing a loved one, a room in your house, etc.  You could recite facts about these things, but a better way to describe them accurately is to picture them in your mind (using your imagination), and the more vividly you can imagine them, the reality of them becomes that much more clear.</p>
<h2 id="aligning-with-god">Aligning with God</h2>
<p>We also talked for a while on how using your imagination during prayer can align you with God's will.  The example was if you had a conflict in your family - a classic way to pray about this would be to pray for the family member, that God would "change their heart", or "help them come around".  </p>
<p>But, if you use your imagination while praying for the family member, you see them as an actual person in your mind, and maybe you end up praying that you would learn how to love them more, or that God would simply bless them.  Maybe God's way for them to "change their heart" was to let them see how much you love them.  </p>
<p>This is obviously just an example of what could happen, but it illustrates how praying with your imagination can open you up more to allow the Holy Spirit to change your perspective, thus aligning you more with God's will.  </p>
<p>When we pray without our imagination, we tend to just say words, and these words usually end up being what <em>we</em> want God to do.  When we pray with our imagination, we allow ourselves to get a better picture of what <em>God</em> wants to do - it somehow opens us up more to the Holy Spirit's promptings.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>We also heard some good examples of how to use your imagination in prayer.  One neat example was when praying for someone, imagine a huge spot-light beam of light falling down on that person as you pray for them - the spot-light represents the power of your prayer through God falling upon them.  This is actually helping you visualize the reality of your prayer (not that our prayer is like a spot-light on them, but your prayer <em>is</em> making a kingdom impact).  Seeing it concretely in your mind will give you the passion and energy to pursue it, and helps us push harder with God to help bring about his will in Heaven here on earth.</p>
<h2 id="listening-to-god">Listening to God</h2>
<p>We also wrapped up with how using your imagination in prayer makes you more receptive to God communicating back with us.  So many Christians only talk <em>to</em> God, but never listen for Him.  A main reason is because it is hard to hear Him - but when using our imagination we can "hear" his prompting even more.  A concern in this is that we worry that our imagination is just telling ourselves what we want to hear and not actually God - if you hear a word from God, and you can back it up in scripture, trust that it is God talking to you.  We also thought that this part of listening to God with our imagination would take time and practice, but as we deepen our communication with God, it will be more clear what is God and what is our mind.</p>
<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
<p>I was pretty excited after our discussion on Sunday.  I would challenge you guys to try to cut out a few minutes of your (busy!) days to practice this.  </p>
<p>We talked about how even praying for something simple like having a good day tomorrow becomes a totally different prayer when using your imagination.  Instead of saying the words "Please help me to have a good day tomorrow", praying for that in your imagination leads you to pray for people you will come into contact with, and to pray a lot more specifically for your day in general.  </p>
<h2 id="stay-focused">Stay Focused!</h2>
<p>Your prayers may wander a bit, but that could just be the Holy Spirit directing your prayers!  </p>
<p>I think the reason I struggle with a meaningful prayer time is because just saying words is dry and (to be honest) boring.  At first, I wanted to be doing something else rather then setting aside a few minutes to talk with God, but what I have found is that by using my imagination while praying I am way more passionate about it - but also, my prayer time lasts a lot longer than I thought it would, and I can't wait to pray again the next time.</p>
<h2 id="next-week">Next Week</h2>
<p>The plan for next Sunday is to cover 1 Thess. 5:17 - Pray without ceasing!  In the next week or so, try to think about these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What draws your attention away from being present with Jesus in every moment of your life?</li>
<li>Who in your life or what ways can you remind yourself to be present with Jesus throughout your day?</li>
</ul>
