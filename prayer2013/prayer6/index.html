                <h1 id="prayer-6">Prayer #6</h1>
<p><em>12/7/2013</em></p>
<p>Here is the recap from our study on Sunday:</p>
<h2 id="what-is-worship">What is worship?</h2>
<p>We started out by reading some verses in Psalms that talk about how we worship God (lifting our hands, shouting to Him, playing instruments, etc.)  Then we heard a way to think of worship as "shipping worth" to God - the actions and thoughts during our worship should be focused on ascribing worth to Him.</p>
<p>The worship time at church on Sundays is more than just a prelude to the sermon.  Just like we talked about with prayer last time - prayer isn't just a once-in-a-while thing... it is a mindset that we should always be in, to pray continuously.  The same goes for worship: It is not just a once-a-week thing - we are to worship God through our thoughts and our actions every moment of every day.  </p>
<p>This does not mean we should be walking around mumbling praises to Him - anything that brings glory to God is a form of worship.  When we choose not to gossip, we are worshiping God.  When we help someone in need, we are worshiping God.  Like we talked about last time about the secular versus the sacred...  When we are living in the sacred, we are worshiping God.</p>
<p>So when we show up for a time of worship on Sunday, we are just transitioning from one form of worship to another form of worship (expressing it through music).</p>
<h2 id="body-and-heart">Body and Heart</h2>
<p>Then we talked about how the body and our heart are connected...  the abundance of joy in our heart will (if we don't stop it) be expressed in our body.   What we do with our body, affects our heart, and what goes on in the heart needs to be expressed with our body (through singing, dancing, shouting, clapping, raising hands, etc - all the verses we talked about).</p>
<h2 id="different-ways-to-worship">Different ways to Worship</h2>
<p>We talked about the different ways to worship God in music (based on the verses we read at the beginning).  We talked about how sometimes dancing for joy and shouting for joy can seem disrespectful in some churches, but in the context of the verses we read, we saw how they bring glory and ascribe worth to God.  Of course, you wouldn't want to go to the front of a super conservative church and start dancing, because that would totally be a distraction to everyone there.  </p>
<p>Also, we talked about how dancing is so "tainted" by society, so to bring it into church sounds sacrilegious.  </p>
<p>We could think of examples, like interpretive dance, where there is no doubt that it is focused on glorifying God.  </p>
<p>A lot of us noticed the gentleman in the service about a month ago who was dancing during worship - and every single one of us noted how his movements actually brought us further into worship - his dancing was not secular - it was bursting forth out of a love for God.</p>
<h2 id="applause">Applause</h2>
<p>We also noted how when we applaud at the end of a song, it is not to congratulate the musicians - but it is to applaud God who made the musicians and the music.  It is a big "thank you God for being awesome".</p>
<h2 id="being-free-to-worship">Being free to worship</h2>
<p>Now, talking about expressing our heart with our body sounds pretty scary to some of us who are more quiet and reserved people.  We talked about how you don't get bonus "points" for dancing rather than singing quietly, and how the people who are clapping aren't necessarily closer to God than the people who are hushed in quiet reverence.  </p>
<p>We talked about how different cultures tend to be more vocal and animated during worship, where others tend to be more reverent.  </p>
<p>The point is that you need to be free to worship the way that works for you - worship is all about participation.  </p>
<p>We ascribe worth to God (ship worth to him - worship) by the <strong>intensity of our focus on Him</strong>.  When our body is expressing what we are singing, we become more passionate and focused on God.</p>
<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>
<p>To take this a step further - we talked about this example:  If you are in a conversation with someone, but you are looking around, noticing everything around you, not really paying attention to them, you are basically letting that person know that they are not that important to you.  </p>
<p>The same is (even more) true with God.  If you are looking around during worship, looking at other people, maybe judging someone because they smell like smoke or aren't singing - you are not focusing on God, and you are basically saying that everything else in the room is more important than Him.  </p>
<p>I'm not trying to say if you ever get distracted during worship that God isn't important to you - but just remember the example of talking to another person.  The more distracted you are, the more you are saying you don't care.  </p>
<p>Worship becomes worship when we make a <em>decision</em> to block out everything else and to focus everything on the One we are singing to, and what we are singing about.</p>
<h2 id="wheres-the-passion">Where's the passion?</h2>
<p>Okay - all of that was basically an introduction to worship:  Having a singular focus (body and heart) on God.  Like we have been talking about with prayer - it is very difficult to just sit down and pray some words and feel passionate about it.  The same goes for worship - if all we are doing is just singing the words, it will be dry and we are less likely to focus.  A way to become more passionate about prayer, and now worship, is to use your imagination. </p>
<h2 id="imagining-worship">Imagining worship</h2>
<p>What brings more passion: To sing the words "The God of angel armies is always by my side. The one who reigns forever - He is a friend of mine", or to imagine those words are you are singing?  For me, to imagine the truth of those words will <em>always</em> bring a passion to my worship rather than just standing there trying to sing the words.  </p>
<p>Like we talked about with imagination and prayer - it is not trying to make things up - but it brings reality closer.  </p>
<p>With the lyrics I gave above - imagine God is standing by your side - imagine holding His hand while you sing this song!  That's not far fetched or making something up - like we talked about last time, we are <em>always</em> in His presence - so it is not far fetched to imagine Him standing next to us when we sing these words.  "The one who reigns forever, He is a friend of mine" - He <em>is</em> your friend - imagine Him like you imagine a friend.</p>
<p>Another example of a song that makes me imagine in vivid pictures is the hymn "Holy, Holy, Holy".  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Holy, holy, holy!<br />
All the saints adore thee
casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
cherubim and seraphim falling down before thee
which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I am singing this song, it is like I can almost physically see our praises rising up to Him as a sweet perfume.  We are the "saints" that are adoring Him, and someday we will cast our golden crowns before Him.  </p>
<p>I try to picture what that will look like - how magnificent it will be.  And then to see the heavenly creatures also fall down before Him.  To me, that whole scene is <em>exploding</em> with worth, streaming up to God.  Like I said, I can almost see it streaming up to Him.</p>
<p>That is just my idea and my representation of those words - others may visualize it differently - but either way, I believe it is visualizing truth.  And, when I am able to visualize the words of a song like that, those are the closest times I feel to God during worship - the passion and focus is definitely there.  Were I just to sing the words, yes, I am still ascribing worth to Him, but I do not think I am as in to it.</p>
<p>The next time you are in the worship part of the service, ask the Holy Spirit to help you envision what you are singing about - it can make the worship time so powerful!</p>
<h2 id="worshiping-together">Worshiping together</h2>
<p>I mentioned before that the worship part of the service is not the only time of the week that we worship since our actions should bring glory to God throughout the day.  However, one awesome part of the worship service at church is that we get to experience that worship with other believers.  Also, like I mentioned above, that gentleman who was really into the music helped many people around him focus on God and the worship.  </p>
<p>The next part we talked about is how our focus (or lack of focus) affects those who are worshiping around us.  Not only does our focus on God bring us closer to God, it can help others around us focus more on God.  In a sense, we owe it to the people around us to be focused on God during worship.  Imagine being in the center of a bunch of people who worship God like that gentleman - after a few songs, I think I would be pretty focused on worship, and probably worshiping with a passion that doesn't happen often.  </p>
<p>Conversely, if you are in the center of a bunch of people who are only singing (if they are even singing) so they can get through the worship part of the service and get to the sermon.  Chances are, those people around you will dampen your worship experience without even knowing it.  </p>
<p>I'm not saying that you can't have an intimate time with God in the middle of people who aren't focused on God, but I am saying this:  Who do you want to be?  Do you want to be the person that is so focused on God during worship that without even knowing it, you are causing people to enter into a more passionate time of worship - or - do you want to be the person who doesn't even realize they are causing other people to have a more dry or distracted experience?  That's obviously a rhetorical question, but it definitely makes me think twice about going into the worship service...</p>
<p>Basically, the worship time is not just for you, but for all of God's people to come together as one body in worship to Him.</p>
<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>
<p>The last thing we talked about was the diversity in worship.  Obviously people have different likes and dislikes when it comes to music and worship.  We are in a society where everyone wants it our way.  As a believer, it is a sign of maturity when you can still remain focused on God when a song comes up that you don't know or don't like.  </p>
<p>If you always had the songs you liked, you wouldn't grow as much.  Other people may like the song you don't like, and vice-versa.   God's kingdom is for every tribe, every tongue, and every nation.  The point is, worship is supposed to be our undivided attention focused on God - it is not about what we can get out of it - it is not for us, but for God.</p>
<h2 id="my-personal-note">My personal note</h2>
<p>Also, one personal note I would like to add: The part where we talked about that people worship differently - some quiet and reverent, some raising hands, etc - and how there isn't a right or wrong way.  Personally, I tend to use this a bit as an excuse to stay reserved.  If my heart is so full of joy that I are feeling led to raise my hands in joy, but I don't because I'm quiet and reserved, I am now believing I am blocking myself from being fully involved in worship.  </p>
<p>If I am feeling surrendered to God during a song and am feeling to bow or lift up my hands in surrender to Him, but I don't because I'm afraid what people think of me, again - I think I am not letting myself be fully surrendered to God.  </p>
<p>This is a personal challenge to me, and maybe a challenge to you.  Again - you don't <em>need</em> to raise your hands or dance or whatever to get closer to God - but - if you are feeling led to express your worship through your body - I encourage you (and me!) to let go and focus completely on worshiping God - instead of thinking "I'm more reserved so it's okay if I just stand here".  I don't think I'm saying it clearly - I don't want it to come across wrong...  </p>
<p>I guess what I'm saying is just go where the Spirit leads - blocking those promptings could be inhibiting your ability to worship fully.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now that our series is done, I'm planning on writing a summary of all of the studies - hopefully a short email of just some key points.</p>
<p>God bless!</p>
