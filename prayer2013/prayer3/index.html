                <h1 id="prayer-3">Prayer #3</h1>
<p><em>10/25/2013</em></p>
<p>I've been working through what we discussed on Sunday night enough to try to write it out.</p>
<p>We started out by reading <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+11%3A24&amp;version=NASB">Mark 11:24</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted you. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mentioned that the topic would be about our faith.</p>
<h2 id="strength-tester-faith">Strength-Tester Faith</h2>
<p>The first couple of segments we listened to dealt with "Strength Testers Faith" - where you feel you have to believe super hard, and try not to doubt in order to have faith.  You almost have to mentally trick yourself into believing something, because you are worried that if you have doubt, that would mean you have a lack of faith, and according to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+11%3A24&amp;version=NASB">Mark 11:24</a>, not believing means you are reducing your chance of receiving.</p>
<p>I don't think I always approach prayer this way, but I certainly have been there (which is kind of funny, because God knows our heart - He would know deep down if we doubt that something will come to pass even though we pray for it).</p>
<h2 id="contradictions">Contradictions</h2>
<p>We heard some examples of why this verse seems to contradict other verses in the Bible, like the verse where Jesus healed the blind man.  He spit in his eyes, prayed, and asked the man if he could see.  If he took his own words from <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+11%3A24&amp;version=NASB">Mark 11:24</a> literally, then why would he ask the blind man if he could see?  Shouldn't the man just believe that he could see and then he would be able to. (A bonus to this story was that the man couldn't see all the way, and Jesus had to pray again - that is profound!)</p>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>We then heard a TON of different variables that may affect the outcome of prayer - I will try to list some that I remember:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Having 2 or more people praying</li>
<li>The faith of the person praying</li>
<li>The faith of the person being prayed for </li>
<li>The spiritual forces working against your prayer</li>
<li>The spiritual forces working for your prayer</li>
</ul>
<p>The list was a lot bigger than that, but the point is, there are <strong>so</strong> many factors that can affect the outcome of prayer, that we can never be certain of the outcome.  If you take <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+11%3A24&amp;version=NASB">Mark 11:24</a> literally, it is telling you to be certain of the outcome in order for it to happen.  Since we can't be certain, then what does the verse mean?</p>
<h2 id="hyperbole">Hyperbole</h2>
<p>We then learned that it was very common in the time of the early church to use hyperbole to get a point across.  The example was "Johnny, I've told you a million times to stop that!"  Obviously you haven't been keeping count, or come close to 1 million times - that is a hyperbole to get your point across.</p>
<p>We learned about some other verses that are hyperboles as well: "If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out" doesn't really mean that we should pluck our eyes out - it drives home the point that we need to deal with temptation and what we allow ourselves to see.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-point">What's the point?</h2>
<p>So if <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+11%3A24&amp;version=NASB">Mark 11:24</a> is an exaggeration to prove a point, what point is it trying to prove?  </p>
<p>The opinion given Sunday was that <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+11%3A24&amp;version=NASB">Mark 11:24</a> is showing us that envisioning the results of our prayers aligns us with God's heart, and our prayers will start to align with God's will.  <em>(I'm still having trouble getting this out on paper - we really worked through a lot on Sunday, and I feel it was really clear... I'm just praying that what I am writing will make sense!)</em>  </p>
<p>The point of the verse wasn't that if you can imagine or believe it coming true, it will come true - it was that getting your attitude and your heart set on the results of your prayer will begin to align you with God's heart.</p>
<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>
<p>Maybe an example will help:  When I was growing up, we cleaned the house <em>every</em> Monday.  If I thought about it with a negative attitude througout the weekend (dreaded it, complained about having to clean) - when Monday came around, I would get into little fights with my mom while we were cleaning, and my cleaning efforts were prettly lousy - I didn't do a good job.  </p>
<p>However, if I thought about having a clean house, and the fun I could have after the house was clean all weekend long, when Monday came, I worked together with my family and did a great job cleaning (and we probably finished a lot faster too!)  </p>
<p>In a way, because I "believed I would receive" (my heart was in the right place), "it was granted to me" (the cleaning job went great!)  By aligning my attitude with my mom's heart to have a clean house, we ended up with a nice clean house, and a happy family.</p>
<p>Anyways - it's not about a mental trick to try to get our prayers answered - it's about stepping out in faith and trusting God to do his work.</p>
<h2 id="another-example">Another example</h2>
<p>One example we heard of this type of prayer was the pastor was praying for a friend with insomnia.  As he prayed for this person, he pictured them sound asleep, smiling, on a nice soft bed.  Again - this is not new-agey, or magical.  It just gives us the right attitude as we pray.  It will probably make the prayer more real to us, and make us more passionate while we pray.</p>
<h2 id="aligning-with-god">Aligning with God</h2>
<p>We talked about how it could even happen where we may be praying in one direction, but as we are envisioning what we are praying for, it aligns us with God's heart, and the spirit may prompt us to pray in another direction, aligning us further with God's heart.</p>
<p>As I have been trying to pray this way, I do find there is a new passion to my prayer.  It helps it feel more real to envision the person I am praying for, and to feel more passionate about praying for them.</p>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>At the end of our discussion, there were some questions and answers about praying with faith.  Since this post super long, I will put the questions/answers in a different post, hopefully this weekend.</p>
<p>God bless you all - thanks for going on this "journey" with me to learn how to strengthen our prayer lives!</p>
