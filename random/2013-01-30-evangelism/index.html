                <h1 id="evangelism">Evangelism</h1>
<p><em>1/30/2013</em></p>
<p>It's been a while since we last met, and since it will be a while until we meet again, I thought I would share some stuff I have been learning. </p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>The topic is <em>evangelism</em>, and to be honest, as soon as I hear that word I feel:</p>
<ol>
<li>Afraid - afraid that I'm going to be led to go up to a stranger and witness to them</li>
<li>Guilty - guilty because think of all the people around me that I haven't witnessed to - what if I was their only chance to become saved?</li>
</ol>
<p>It also makes me feel like I am making excuses, like:  Not all people have the gift of evangelism, so for those of us that don't, our Christ-like example is the way we witness to others.  That is probably true, but I still feel guilty, because what if I'm just using that as an excuse to avoid an awkward conversation with a stranger?</p>
<p>What I have been learning recently, however, has taught me a new way to view evangelism.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-evangelism">History of Evangelism</h2>
<p>To go back to the "roots" of God's intent to witness to the world, you can look to Genesis, at the life of Abraham.  Around chapter 12, and many other chapters, Abraham is told that through his children, and their children, all nations will be reached.  This of course refers to the nation of Israel.  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+12%3A3&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 12:3</a> says that all people and nations will be blessed through Abraham.  The way that Israel was supposed to bless all nations was to live a different lifestyle than the nations around them, so that the other nations could see what it was like to live under God's blessings and protection.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Israel often got into the habit of making God exclusively theirs and trying to live completely cut-off from the world.  Or, they would neglect God, and not live the different lifestyle that God called them to live, and became the same as the nations around them.  Israel forgot that they were supposed to be priests that served the world, and instead they judged the world and tried to make God their own separate God.</p>
<h2 id="then-jesus-came">Then Jesus Came</h2>
<p>When Jesus came, he destroyed this old way, and made a new covenant not centered around a nation, but one that is available to every individual and calls us to love one another.  Jesus made it clear that His love was to be shared with all, and not be made exclusive for any particular person or group.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A16&amp;version=NASB">Galatians 3:16 (NASB)</a> makes this pretty clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed.  He does not say, 'And to seeds,' as referring to many, but rather to one, 'And to your seed', that is, Christ."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse confirms that Abraham's calling was directly looking forward to Jesus coming, but instead the Israelites took that to mean that God was only for them.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-fit-in">How we fit in</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A9&amp;version=NIV">1 Peter 2:9</a> says that we are a chosen race, a people for God's own possession, so that we may proclaim the Glory of Him who called us out of darkness and into His marvelous light.</p>
<p>That means that all who have faith are the <em>new</em> Israel - all that was called of Israel is now called of us - we are to show the world how to live a different life to show others the effects of living under God.</p>
<p>We often think of our salvation as a personal salvation - "I am saved, so now I can go to heaven".  While this is true, we need to remember that we don't just exist for us but also for the world.  We aren't just saved to save ourselves, but to save others as well.  Our salvation isn't just for us, but for all of the world.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-evangelism-then">What is evangelism, then?</h2>
<p>Evangelism isn't a calling to do something, but to <strong>be</strong> something.  We evangelize by "being" - by showing the world what it is like to be loved by God - just like Israel was called to do.</p>
<p>We are a part of God's family.  We should live in a way that manifests the beautiful love of God.</p>
<p>We become like Israel when we live <em>separate</em> from the world, or when we try to keep God to ourselves.  It is convenient to live life in a closed circle, but there are people around us that are hungry with what we have.</p>
<h2 id="a-challenge">A Challenge</h2>
<p>So, I will put forth a challenge - and this is just as much a challenge to me:</p>
<p>Pick one person that you think is a non-Christian, and pray for them every day.  As you pray for them, be open to God leading you in ways to reveal His love to that person.  It doesn't even have to involve a direct conversation with them (at first) - but can eventually turn into a relationship where they can be drawn into the family of God.</p>
<p>Also - ask God to reveal one area of your life that blends in a little too much with the world.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>To summarize:  </p>
<ul>
<li>We have been made a part of the amazing family of God.  </li>
<li>We have the overwhelming, unfathomable love of God pouring on us.  </li>
<li>It is comfortable for us to hang out with this awesome family and never branch out to people not in our family, but we need to realize that there are people who see us and know that we have something special, and they would give anything to be a part of that family.  </li>
<li>Our call to evangelize is not to have scary confrontations with people, shoving the Bible down their throats.  </li>
<li>Our call to evangelize means that we need to show others the wonderful love of God that we have received.  </li>
<li>Once people become hungry for this love, it opens the door for a relationship with them - they will eventually become comfortable enough to talk about what life with Christ is like.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>Evangelism should never involve forced, unnatural conversation, but letting someone feel the attraction of our "family" - that they are probably already hungry for.</p>
<p>God bless!</p>
