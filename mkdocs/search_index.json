            "text": "Cancelled\n\n\n9/10/2012\n\n\nIntro to this long note\n\n\nI've been learning a lot this summer about the forgiveness of sins and living free under the blood of Christ.  Some of it has been from sermons I've heard, some from books I've read, and a lot directly from the Bible.  In fact, I'm kind of excited for our upcoming study in Colossians, because one of the key passages I wanted to share is from Colossians.  \n\n\nAnyways - I really wanted to share what I was learning because it really changed how I look at God's forgiveness and I thought maybe it might be an encouragement to the group.  If not, sorry for a long, rambling email =) Or maybe this is common knowledge to everyone except me...\n\n\nPersonal background\n\n\nEver since I was little, I was taught that when we sin, we need to confess our sins to God and ask forgiveness.  While I still believe this is true, I think my understanding of \nwhy\n I should do this, is changing.  When confessing a sin to God it always felt like I was cowering before the Almighty, begging Him to forgive me.  It was the same feeling when I was little: if I did something real bad and I knew I was going to get punished when we got home, I would plead and beg for mom to forgive me so I could hopefully lessen the punishment.\n\n\nAt the same time, I was taught that God forgives our sins, and \"once saved, always saved.\"\n\n\nI don't think that I ask God for forgiveness because I'm afraid I'm going to go to hell, but it is a desperate feeling of needing the forgiveness from God after each sin.  But like I said, the things I have been learning this summer are really helping transform my thinking about why I ask God for forgiveness, and the true power of His forgiveness.\n\n\nLife-changing verse\n\n\nThe verse I read in Colossians really impacted me: \nColossians 2:13-14(NIV)\n\n\n\n\n\"When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross.\"\n\n\n\n\nThat first part makes a lot of sense - we were dead in our sins, but God saved us and made us alive with Christ.  It was verse 14 that hit me:\n\n\n\n\n\"having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness \nwhich stood against us and condemned us\n; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross\".\n\n\n\n\nThe verse says that our legal indebtedness condemned us, \nnot\n God.  I have always kind of pictured God as the lightning-bolt-zapping God waiting to punish those who sin against Him, and I had to beg for forgiveness after I sin.\n\n\nBut this verse makes it clear (to me, at least) that we were indebted to, and condemned by, the law - but God \ncancelled\n that charge and nailed it to the cross!  The bad guy here is really the devil - he is the one who demands the payment for our sins.  He is the accuser, who accuses us when we sin.  \nGalations 3:13(NIV)\n says:\n\n\n\n\n\"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.\"\n\n\n\n\nRomans 8:33(NIV)\n says:\n\n\n\n\n\"Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.\"\n\n\n\n\nGod doesn't hold our sin over us and demand payment, the accuser (devil) does. God came and he not only paid our debt - he \ncancelled\n it.  Just like \nRomans 8:1(NIV)\n says:\n\n\n\n\n\"Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus\"\n\n\n\n\nOnce I started thinking in the mindset of the charges of my sin being cancelled (instead of having to be repaid), it really made me think differently about asking for forgiveness.\n\n\nAn example\n\n\nThis example helped make it even more clear to me:\n\n\nThink of the number of times you have sinned in your life - your entire life.  (in my case, I think it is a pretty big number)\n\n\nNow think of the number of sins you have confessed to God and asked for forgiveness.\n\n\nAre those 2 numbers the same?  In my case, the first number was a lot bigger than the second number.\n\n\nWhen I pictured my debt to sin, I always pictured it like a monetary debt, where somehow the debt of my sins had to be paid.  Asking God for forgiveness somehow paid that debt.  However, in the context of the 2 numbers above, I was \nway\n behind in asking for forgiveness, and therefore still in debt.\n\n\nIn the context of the verses I shared above, the debt is gone because Christ cancelled it!  It's hard to understand because in our world, a debt has to be paid.  The president couldn't go to all the mortgage companies and just tell them to cancel all the mortgages - someone would have to pay for it - the money has to come from somewhere.  But it's different for God.  He completely did away with our debt - it was gone the moment we asked him to save us.\n\n\nAnother way to think about it:  When Jesus died for my sins back 2000 years ago, how many sins had I committed then?  Zero, because I wasn't even alive yet.  By cancelling my charges 2000 years ago, there are no longer any charges of debt against the sins I commit today.\n\n\nThat doesn't mean I don't ask for forgiveness though...\n\n\nParty like it's 1999?\n\n\nWhen I mention that all my sins were forgiven 2000 years ago and I'm \"all set\" once I ask Christ to save me, it sounds like a free pass to commit sins and be off the hook.  To some extent, I think that may even be true: Good things can be abused.  A small example, is those \"need a penny take a penny, have a penny give a penny\" things.  That's a good thing, and it can help people from time to time.  But someone could literally go to each of those things and take all the money out.  That doesn't make those things bad - someone was just taking advantage of it.  It's a very small-scale example, but it shows how something good is still good, even if people do bad things with it.  \n\n\nHowever, if we are in an intimate relationship in-tune with God, we will feel remorse when we bring sin between us and God, and that is why we ask for forgiveness.  Asking for forgiveness isn't to ensure our salvation on an ongoing basis.  It is because we brought something bad into our relationship with God, and by confessing and asking for forgiveness, we make our relationship right again so we can remain close to Him.\n\n\nIt's kind of like when one of our children is mean to the other child.  The forgiveness part is to repair the relationship between the two of them.  It's not like if they don't ask for forgiveness they would get kicked out of the family, or they wouldn't be siblings anymore.  If one child was always mean to the other child and never asked for forgiveness and was never forgiven, that relationship probably wouldn't be good once they got older.\n\n\nIt is about the mending of a relationship: If we are in a close relationship with God, we will want to confess and ask for forgiveness so we can be close again.\n\n\nWhat about ongoing sin?\n\n\nThe only part about all of the above that is hard for me is the habitual sin.  The \"cyclic\" sins - the ones where you sin, ask for forgiveness, and then find yourself in that same sin again.\n\n\nHere is my take on those:  I believe that the feeling of remorse after sinning the same sin for the umpteenth time is the Holy Spirit reminding you that there is something between you and God.  The fact that you ask for forgiveness is a sign that you want to make things right with God, and that you are growing in God.  Keep on growing in God and asking for forgiveness.  If it is a lifelong sin that you just can't beat, maybe try seeking a good Christian friend for accountability.\n\n\nI guess the point I am trying to make in this paragraph is that I believe when we were saved, Christ has already died for ALL of our sins, even when we keep committing them.  Being forgiven of these habitual sins helps make our relationship closer to God.\n\n\nIf you \never\n feel under attack from sins you have committed in the past, just know that Satan is the one who is reminding you of this, because God destroyed the whole \nsystem\n of debt to sin (like I mentioned above).\n\n\nYou are no longer dead in your sins, but redeemed by the blood of Jesus!\n\n\nA song\n\n\nI really like the lyrics to the song \n\"Beautiful Things\"\n by Gungor.\n\n\nHere are the lyrics:\n\n\n\n\nAll this pain\n\n\nI wonder if I'll ever find my way\n\n\nI wonder if my life could really change at all\n\n\nAll this earth\n\n\nCould all that is lost ever be found\n\n\nCould a garden come up from this ground at all\n\n\n\n\nYou make beautiful things\n\n\nYou make beautiful things out of the dust\n\n\nYou make beautiful things\n\n\nYou make beautiful things out of us\n\n\n\n\nAll around\n\n\nHope is springing up from this old ground\n\n\nOut of chaos life is being found in You\n\n\n\n\nYou make me new, You are making me new\n\n\nYou make me new, You are making me new\n\n\nYou are making me new\n\n\n\n\nHere is why I like this song:  We were saved by God.  He \ncancelled\n the charges of our sin.  Only our Awesome God has the power to take us (when we can make such a mess of our lives) and make us \ninnocent\n again.  He has the power to actually take us back to innocence, like a newborn baby.  He makes us new, as though we had never sinned.\n\n\nWrapping up\n\n\nThis note is super long, and I pray that God is somehow able to use my jumbled mess of words, and make them clear to you as you read it.\n\n\nI pray that maybe it can impact you like it is impacting me.  It is like I don't live in fear of offending God anymore, but after I sin, I have the opportunity to make my relationship right with Him again.\n\n\nHe loves us so much that He literally washed our sins away so we are as white as snow - innocent as a baby, like we have never sinned.  He cast our sins as far as the East is from the West (\nPsalm 103:12\n).  How far is that?  The Voyager 1 spacecraft from NASA is the farthest man-made object from Earth.  It has been traveling away from Earth since 1977, and it is still traveling away from Earth at a speed of about 10 miles per second.  It is more than 11,300,000,000 miles away (as of September 2012) from Earth and getting farther away all the time.  AND, it is still inside our Galaxy (that just shows how small we are in the context of space).  Imagine if NASA had released another spacecraft in the exact opposite direction - those two would be SUPER far away from each other.  Imagine they travel away from each other for 1,000 years.  That's not even a fraction of how far the east is from the west.  That is how far God removed our sins from us.  In other words - your sins are gone.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nAs a Christian - you are free from your sins, free from the charge of those sins, and in a relationship with the God who made you free.  God wants to love us , not punish us.  Once I started viewing God like this, it really started to change my relationship with Him, and maybe this email can help change your view of Him as well?\n\n\nThanks for putting up with this long note.\n\n\nGod bless!",

That is probably true, but I still feel guilty, because what if I'm just using that as an excuse to avoid an awkward conversation with a stranger?\n\n\nWhat I have been learning recently, however, has taught me a new way to view evangelism.\n\n\nHistory of Evangelism\n\n\nTo go back to the \"roots\" of God's intent to witness to the world, you can look to Genesis, at the life of Abraham.  Around chapter 12, and many other chapters, Abraham is told that through his children, and their children, all nations will be reached.  This of course refers to the nation of Israel.  \nGenesis 12:3\n says that all people and nations will be blessed through Abraham.  The way that Israel was supposed to bless all nations was to live a different lifestyle than the nations around them, so that the other nations could see what it was like to live under God's blessings and protection.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Israel often got into the habit of making God exclusively theirs and trying to live completely cut-off from the world.  Or, they would neglect God, and not live the different lifestyle that God called them to live, and became the same as the nations around them.  Israel forgot that they were supposed to be priests that served the world, and instead they judged the world and tried to make God their own separate God.\n\n\nThen Jesus Came\n\n\nWhen Jesus came, he destroyed this old way, and made a new covenant not centered around a nation, but one that is available to every individual and calls us to love one another.  Jesus made it clear that His love was to be shared with all, and not be made exclusive for any particular person or group.\n\n\nGalatians 3:16 (NASB)\n makes this pretty clear:\n\n\n\n\n\"Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed.  He does not say, 'And to seeds,' as referring to many, but rather to one, 'And to your seed', that is, Christ.\"\n\n\n\n\nThis verse confirms that Abraham's calling was directly looking forward to Jesus coming, but instead the Israelites took that to mean that God was only for them.\n\n\nHow we fit in\n\n\n1 Peter 2:9\n says that we are a chosen race, a people for God's own possession, so that we may proclaim the Glory of Him who called us out of darkness and into His marvelous light.\n\n\nThat means that all who have faith are the \nnew\n Israel - all that was called of Israel is now called of us - we are to show the world how to live a different life to show others the effects of living under God.\n\n\nWe often think of our salvation as a personal salvation - \"I am saved, so now I can go to heaven\".  While this is true, we need to remember that we don't just exist for us but also for the world.  We aren't just saved to save ourselves, but to save others as well.  Our salvation isn't just for us, but for all of the world.\n\n\nWhat is evangelism, then?\n\n\nEvangelism isn't a calling to do something, but to \nbe\n something.  We evangelize by \"being\" - by showing the world what it is like to be loved by God - just like Israel was called to do.\n\n\nWe are a part of God's family.  We should live in a way that manifests the beautiful love of God.\n\n\nWe become like Israel when we live \nseparate\n from the world, or when we try to keep God to ourselves.  It is convenient to live life in a closed circle, but there are people around us that are hungry with what we have.\n\n\nA Challenge\n\n\nSo, I will put forth a challenge - and this is just as much a challenge to me:\n\n\nPick one person that you think is a non-Christian, and pray for them every day.  As you pray for them, be open to God leading you in ways to reveal His love to that person.  It doesn't even have to involve a direct conversation with them (at first) - but can eventually turn into a relationship where they can be drawn into the family of God.\n\n\nAlso - ask God to reveal one area of your life that blends in a little too much with the world.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nTo summarize:  \n\n\n\n\nWe have been made a part of the amazing family of God.  \n\n\nWe have the overwhelming, unfathomable love of God pouring on us.  \n\n\nIt is comfortable for us to hang out with this awesome family and never branch out to people not in our family, but we need to realize that there are people who see us and know that we have something special, and they would give anything to be a part of that family.  \n\n\nOur call to evangelize is not to have scary confrontations with people, shoving the Bible down their throats.  \n\n\nOur call to evangelize means that we need to show others the wonderful love of God that we have received.  \n\n\nOnce people become hungry for this love, it opens the door for a relationship with them - they will eventually become comfortable enough to talk about what life with Christ is like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing\n\n\nEvangelism should never involve forced, unnatural conversation, but letting someone feel the attraction of our \"family\" - that they are probably already hungry for.\n\n\nGod bless!",

Predestination is one of those tough topics to understand, but I recently heard an example/analogy that helped me picture it a little easier.\n\n\nTrain example\n\n\nThe example relates predestination to a train.  A train is \"predestined\" to go somewhere - meaning that someone planned out that, on a certain day, this train will travel from this city to that city with a number of stops on the way.\n\n\nA person can choose to board the train, and the moment they give their ticket and get on the train, they are now predestined to go where the train is going.  Everything predestined for the train, is now predestined for that person.  The person could choose to not board the train, and then would not be predestined to have what the train has to offer.  That certainly doesn't mean that the person couldn't have chosen to board the train.\n\n\nChurch example\n\n\nAnother example is when our pastor prepares a sermon at church.  It is predestined that anyone who comes to church will hear the message he prepared.  If we choose to show up, we are predestined to hear that message.  If we choose not to show up, we will not hear the message.  That doesn't mean that our pastor picks and chooses who gets to hear the message - it means that we have the choice to hear the message, and once we choose to, we are hearing a message that we were predestined to hear.\n\n\nGod\n\n\nI think (my opinion) that God knows all of the possible choices we could make, and if we choose one thing (to go to church, for example), our time at church will be what God predestined it to be.  I honestly believe that God lets us make that choice to go, and we have the ability to choose not to go (instead of God planning out the exact path through life without us having the ability to make free will choices.)\n\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to share these 2 little examples because it really helped me picture predestination a little better.\n\n\n\n\nDay of Choices\n\n\nI was just about to send this note but I thought of another example:\n\n\nI'm at work, so I created this drawing pretty quick and sloppy, but hopefully it illustrates what I meant:\n\n\n\n\nBasically, the bottom of the drawing is when you wake up in the morning.  You have a choice as soon as you wake up.  It could be to snooze the alarm, or get up right away.  It could be to make breakfast, or to get onto Facebook.  I'm just making stuff up, but you get the idea.  \n\n\nThe dots on the picture show where there are choices to make.  The green highlighted path is an example of how most of our days would end up - somewhere in the middle.  But at the top of the picture, you can see the extreme range of possible ways you could end your day.  \n\n\nIt's true, that if you look at one of the dots, making one choice versus the other choice doesn't really affect you that much.  If you look at the entire day, your choices really can cause some variance in your life.  \n\n\nYou could then make one of these pictures for a month of your life, a year of your life, and one for your entire lifetime.  The range of possibilities would be massive.  \n\n\nThe point?\n\n\nMy point in what I said above is that I believe that God sees the entire \"picture\" of your life before you were born, knows about all of those choices you can make, and knows the outcome of every choice.  \n\n\nTo tie it to predestination and the picture I drew: God predestined that picture for you, but I believe you got to choose your way through it (the green highlighted line).  I really believe that we have the free will to choose a different path.  \n\n\nIn that sense, you are predestined for all of those paths, but you have the choice to go one way versus another.  At the end of the day, the path you took was predestined for you, but had you chosen a different path, that way would have been predestined for you as well.\n\n\nHopefully I didn't just muddy the waters by adding the picture :)\n\n\nGod Bless!",

The sermon wasn't about prayer  - it was about how we serve a God of the unexpected.  \n\n\nSince it is near Christmas he was talking about the birth of Jesus and how the Jews were expecting their messiah to be a mighty warrior to deliver them from the Romans.  Instead, he was born to a poor girl, visited by poor shepherds, and had nothing \"expected\" about Him.  Nothing happened the way the Jews were praying and expecting it to happen.\n\n\nTowards the end of the sermon, he was saying to keep your eyes open for the unexpected.  We use the phrase \"putting God in a box\" which is basically saying you expect God to do something a certain way... But we should know that he does things unexpected, so don't try to expect God to behave a certain way.\n\n\nThe part that related to our prayer study was this: in our fallen state, we like to run things and control things our way.  We feel secure when we are in charge.  This is essentially trying to be lord of our own life.  \n\n\nWe need to cast our cares on Him, trusting that he will meet our needs.\nWhen we pray, we need to \nkeep our eyes open for the unexpected\n. If we think we know how he is going to answer a prayer, we are probably going to miss the answer to the prayer.  Pray with your eyes open to how God might surprise you.\n\n\nThis reminded me of one of our earlier studies on praying along with God's will, and how sometimes we pray for what \nwe\n want God's will to be.  I thought this little part of this sermon matched up with what we talked about, so I thought I would pass it on.\n\n\nI hope you all have a great rest of the week!",

            "text": "Prayer #1\n\n\n9/23/2013\n\n\n\n\nI had a great time starting our study on prayer with you all last night!  \n\n\nA quick summary is that we talked about how God wants us to pray (we've heard that before) but that He also \nneeds\n our prayers.  \n\n\nWe talked about how our physical actions can affect people's lives (we can drive drunk, or choose to help someone in danger), so why wouldn't our prayers affect people as well?\n\n\nWe imagined a reservoir of power that God set aside, and how it is like a trust fund, where we both have to release it together.\n\n\nIt is a big change in thinking to imagine God \nneeding\n anything - which we were able to discuss a lot last night.\n\n\nI took some time during breakfast today to look up some verses that seem to show how prayer impacted God's decision.  In trying to keep this note shorter, I am trimming out some parts of the passages, so it might be good to look them up and read them in their full context.  \n\n\n(The translation I am using is NASB)\n\n\nExodus 32:11-14\n\n\n\n\nThen Moses entreated the Lord his God, and said, \u201cO Lord, why does Your anger burn against Your people whom You have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, \u2018With evil intent He brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth\u2019? Turn from Your burning anger and change Your mind about doing harm to Your people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants to whom You swore by Yourself, and said to them, \u2018I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.\u2019\u201d So the Lord changed His mind about the harm which He said He would do to His people.\n\n\n\n\nThis was after Moses met with God and then came down to find the Israelites worshiping the golden calf.  God said He would destroy them, but in the passage above you can see Moses interceding on their behalf.  The last verse shows God changing his mind (in other translations it says that God relented).\n\n\n2 Kings 20:1-6\n\n\n\n\nIn those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, \u201cThus says the Lord, \u2018Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.\u2019\u201d Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, saying, \u201cRemember now, O Lord, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart and have done what is good in Your sight.\u201d And Hezekiah wept bitterly. Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, \u201cReturn and say to Hezekiah the leader of My people, \u2018Thus says the Lord, the God of your father David, \u201cI have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord. I will add fifteen years to your life, and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for My own sake and for My servant David\u2019s sake.\u201d\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHere God told Hezekiah that he would be dead soon.  Hezekiah wept, prayed, and beseeched the Lord. God then told Hezekiah that he heard his prayers and would add 15 years onto his life.\n\n\nExodus 17:11\n\n\n(This one is from a story that has always fascinated me)\n\n\n\n\nSo it came about when Moses held his hand up, that Israel prevailed, and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed.\n\n\n\n\nThe Israelites were in a battle with the Amalekites.  When Moses kept his staff lifted up, the Israelites were winning, but when he let his hands come down, they would start to lose.  His arms got tired, and his brother and friend had to help him keep his hands up so that they would win the battle.\n\n\nI certainly don't believe Moses was a magician or that his staff had some supernatural powers.  I believe that God helped the Israelites win as long as Moses kept his staff raised high.  \n\n\nThis passage doesn't mention anything about prayer, but it does show how Moses directly influenced the supernatural.  I think it is a good way to envision our prayers as well.  Imagine if we could see the results of our prayers like that!\n\n\nNumbers 14:12-20\n\n\n\n\nThe Lord said to Moses, \u201cHow long will this people spurn Me? And how long will they not believe in Me, despite all the signs which I have performed in their midst? I will smite them with pestilence and dispossess them\"...\nBut Moses said to the Lord ... Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness, just as You also have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.\u201d So the Lord said, \u201cI have pardoned them according to your word.\"\n\n\n\n\nI cut a lot out of this one because it was a big passage.  Basically, the Israelites rebelled against God and said they would rather go back to Egypt.  God says he was going to smite them, but Moses interceded on their behalf.  God said that he would pardon them as Moses requested.\n\n\nJeremiah 18:11\n\n\n(This type of verse is familiar in the old testament)\n\n\n\n\nThus says the Lord, \u201cBehold, I am fashioning calamity against you and devising a plan against you. Oh turn back, each of you from his evil way, and reform your ways and your deeds.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThis makes you wonder - is it an idle threat, or would God really destroy them if they don't reform their ways?  \n\n\nWe see multiple times that when Israel didn't repent, their nation was smashed and they were killed and taken as slaves - so I do not take it as an idle threat.  \n\n\nWe also see times when Israel did repent, and they lived prosperous lives (until the next time they neglected God).\n\n\nEzekiel 22:30\n\n\n\n\nI searched for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before Me for the land, so that I would not destroy it; but I found no one.\n\n\n\n\nThat one is amazing: God is looking for someone to \"stand in the gap\" for the land! Unfortunately, He did not find anyone, and poured out His wrath.",

            "text": "9/23/2013   I had a great time starting our study on prayer with you all last night!    A quick summary is that we talked about how God wants us to pray (we've heard that before) but that He also  needs  our prayers.    We talked about how our physical actions can affect people's lives (we can drive drunk, or choose to help someone in danger), so why wouldn't our prayers affect people as well?  We imagined a reservoir of power that God set aside, and how it is like a trust fund, where we both have to release it together.  It is a big change in thinking to imagine God  needing  anything - which we were able to discuss a lot last night.  I took some time during breakfast today to look up some verses that seem to show how prayer impacted God's decision.  In trying to keep this note shorter, I am trimming out some parts of the passages, so it might be good to look them up and read them in their full context.    (The translation I am using is NASB)",

Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, \u2018With evil intent He brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth\u2019? Turn from Your burning anger and change Your mind about doing harm to Your people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants to whom You swore by Yourself, and said to them, \u2018I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.\u2019\u201d So the Lord changed His mind about the harm which He said He would do to His people.   This was after Moses met with God and then came down to find the Israelites worshiping the golden calf.  God said He would destroy them, but in the passage above you can see Moses interceding on their behalf.

            "text": "Prayer #3\n\n\n10/25/2013\n\n\nI've been working through what we discussed on Sunday night enough to try to write it out.\n\n\nWe started out by reading \nMark 11:24\n:\n\n\n\n\nTherefore I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted you. \n\n\n\n\nI mentioned that the topic would be about our faith.\n\n\nStrength-Tester Faith\n\n\nThe first couple of segments we listened to dealt with \"Strength Testers Faith\" - where you feel you have to believe super hard, and try not to doubt in order to have faith.  You almost have to mentally trick yourself into believing something, because you are worried that if you have doubt, that would mean you have a lack of faith, and according to \nMark 11:24\n, not believing means you are reducing your chance of receiving.\n\n\nI don't think I always approach prayer this way, but I certainly have been there (which is kind of funny, because God knows our heart - He would know deep down if we doubt that something will come to pass even though we pray for it).\n\n\nContradictions\n\n\nWe heard some examples of why this verse seems to contradict other verses in the Bible, like the verse where Jesus healed the blind man.  He spit in his eyes, prayed, and asked the man if he could see.  If he took his own words from \nMark 11:24\n literally, then why would he ask the blind man if he could see?  Shouldn't the man just believe that he could see and then he would be able to. (A bonus to this story was that the man couldn't see all the way, and Jesus had to pray again - that is profound!)\n\n\nVariables\n\n\nWe then heard a TON of different variables that may affect the outcome of prayer - I will try to list some that I remember:  \n\n\n\n\nHaving 2 or more people praying\n\n\nThe faith of the person praying\n\n\nThe faith of the person being prayed for \n\n\nThe spiritual forces working against your prayer\n\n\nThe spiritual forces working for your prayer\n\n\n\n\nThe list was a lot bigger than that, but the point is, there are \nso\n many factors that can affect the outcome of prayer, that we can never be certain of the outcome.  If you take \nMark 11:24\n literally, it is telling you to be certain of the outcome in order for it to happen.  Since we can't be certain, then what does the verse mean?\n\n\nHyperbole\n\n\nWe then learned that it was very common in the time of the early church to use hyperbole to get a point across.  The example was \"Johnny, I've told you a million times to stop that!\"  Obviously you haven't been keeping count, or come close to 1 million times - that is a hyperbole to get your point across.\n\n\nWe learned about some other verses that are hyperboles as well: \"If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out\" doesn't really mean that we should pluck our eyes out - it drives home the point that we need to deal with temptation and what we allow ourselves to see.\n\n\nWhat's the point?\n\n\nSo if \nMark 11:24\n is an exaggeration to prove a point, what point is it trying to prove?  \n\n\nThe opinion given Sunday was that \nMark 11:24\n is showing us that envisioning the results of our prayers aligns us with God's heart, and our prayers will start to align with God's will.  \n(I'm still having trouble getting this out on paper - we really worked through a lot on Sunday, and I feel it was really clear... I'm just praying that what I am writing will make sense!)\n  \n\n\nThe point of the verse wasn't that if you can imagine or believe it coming true, it will come true - it was that getting your attitude and your heart set on the results of your prayer will begin to align you with God's heart.\n\n\nAn example\n\n\nMaybe an example will help:  When I was growing up, we cleaned the house \nevery\n Monday.  If I thought about it with a negative attitude througout the weekend (dreaded it, complained about having to clean) - when Monday came around, I would get into little fights with my mom while we were cleaning, and my cleaning efforts were prettly lousy - I didn't do a good job.  \n\n\nHowever, if I thought about having a clean house, and the fun I could have after the house was clean all weekend long, when Monday came, I worked together with my family and did a great job cleaning (and we probably finished a lot faster too!)  \n\n\nIn a way, because I \"believed I would receive\" (my heart was in the right place), \"it was granted to me\" (the cleaning job went great!)

I don't think I always approach prayer this way, but I certainly have been there (which is kind of funny, because God knows our heart - He would know deep down if we doubt that something will come to pass even though we pray for it).",

            "text": "Prayer #3 - Q\nA\n\n\n10/25/2013\n\n\nI was finally able to transcribe the questions and answers that we didn't get to listen to on Sunday.\n\n\nQuestion #1\n\n\n\"If knowing God is so important, why doesn't God make it easier to know the truth?\"\n\n\nSome of the fogginess between us and God is a result of us living in a fallen world.  God doesn't will the \"fog\" to be there, but he can use it: he wants us to seek him (\nMatthew 7:7\n).  \n\n\nHe wants a bride who pursues him and will work on the relationship.  Those who have a heart for God will pursue and ask questions.  \n\n\nThere have been times in the Bible where God cuts through the fog to make himself obvious.  We can say \"If only I had God speak to me through a burning bush, then I would believe\" - but most of the time in the Bible when these things happened, there was an initial awe of God, but in time, that would fade away.  \n\n\nWhen God is obvious and shows up to His people directly, it does not always have the impact you think it would.\n\n\nQuestion #2\n\n\nHow can I increase my faith if I don't have an active imagination\n\n\nYou do have an imagination, you probably just aren't visual.  Think about something good that is going to happen in the near future (Job promotion, going out on a date, seeing a loved one, etc).  If you feel any excitement when thinking about this event, you are imagining it.  \n\n\nHave you ever been excited about anything in the future?  If you have, it is because you were imagining what it was going to be like.  Maybe you aren't visual and can't \"see\" it; instead you imagine the sounds or the feeling of it - this is still your imagination.  You couldn't remember anything, or anticipate anything if you didn't have an imagination.\n\n\nWhen praying, enter into that imagination, and magnify it - try to think about it with all 5 senses.  This creates a response in us as though it was real.  It is a neurological fact that the way we think and imagine is by our brain re-activating neurons in our brain that are roughly the same as when we experience it in reality.  We remember and anticipate things by replicating the reality of it in our minds.\n\n\nPraying in faith is anticipating what we are praying for by thinking about it as though it is real.  As we discussed on Sunday, this makes us more passionate about what we are praying about and begins to align us with God's heart.\n\n\nQuestion #3\n\n\nHow do we deal with disappointments when our prayers aren't answered?\n\n\nThis may be the case of the \"strength tester\" model of faith where you believe if you don't receive what you prayed for, you must not have had enough faith or prayed hard enough.  \n\n\nInstead, start out by admitting that you don't know whether the prayer will be answered the way you want it, but knowing that your prayer will have kingdom impact.  There are so many variables that affect the outcome of prayers.  Being aware of that can help you not feel so disappointed if a prayer is not \"answered\".  Your prayer is a success because you are obeying God by stepping out in faith, even though you don't know what the outcome will be.  \n\n\nDefine success by obeying God by exercising the kind of faith He wants us to have.\n\n\nQuestion #4\n\n\nWhy don't we see more healings happen?\n\n\n(My note: The pastor states that this answer is all his opinion.  He has no idea why we don't see more miracles, but here is a way he explains it, using an analogy)\n\n\nThere is nothing in the New Testament that indicates that miracles were supposed to stop, but by the second century, miracles started to happen less.  In the 4th century, the church started to believe that miracles were only for the early church.  Looking through history, you can see that miracles come in pockets, or outbreaks.  Revivals happen sporadically through history, often accompanied by miracles.  \n\n\nThis probably isn't because we lack faith during the \"down times\".  \n\n\nThere are many other variables that are influencing what is going on.  We are in a world that is spiritually oppressed, kind of like the earth is \"oppressed\" by clouds that block the sunlight.  God's power is like the sun, and once in a while (for reasons we can't understand), the clouds break a little bit and the power of God falls on earth, like the sun breaking through the clouds.  \n\n\nThis can bring an outbreak of miracles and a revival, but eventually the clouds close up again.  The \"clouds\" are not equal all over the earth - they seem to be thinner in some 3rd world countries where miracles tend to happen more often.  Maybe they have more faith, or maybe there are just so many other things in those areas that we will never understand which affect the spiritual realm in their area of the earth.\n\n\nThe bottom line\n: We don't know why miracles don't happen very often, but it shouldn't affect how we live.  Continue to be obedient to God by praying in faith, and trust that God is in control.  If you are praying for someone to be healed, exercise your faith by seeing their healing as vividly as you can and press forward in your prayers for their healing.  But don't blame yourself if that person is not healed - there are so many other variables we cannot know.",

We talked about \n2 Corinthians 3:14-18\n where Paul describes this type of seeing, and uses the analogy of our mind being like a mirror in which we can \"see\" God.  \"Seeing\" God this way eventually transforms us: When we imagine God's love for us, it makes us more loving; when we imagine God's joy over us, it makes us more joyful.\n\n\nReality\n\n\nWe also learned that satan doesn't want us to use our imagination this way - a good example is how today people mostly associate your imagination with fantasy - creating images in your mind that are not real to escape reality.  We talked about how imagination can actually bring you closer to reality:  Describing a loved one, a room in your house, etc.  You could recite facts about these things, but a better way to describe them accurately is to picture them in your mind (using your imagination), and the more vividly you can imagine them, the reality of them becomes that much more clear.\n\n\nAligning with God\n\n\nWe also talked for a while on how using your imagination during prayer can align you with God's will.  The example was if you had a conflict in your family - a classic way to pray about this would be to pray for the family member, that God would \"change their heart\", or \"help them come around\".  \n\n\nBut, if you use your imagination while praying for the family member, you see them as an actual person in your mind, and maybe you end up praying that you would learn how to love them more, or that God would simply bless them.  Maybe God's way for them to \"change their heart\" was to let them see how much you love them.  \n\n\nThis is obviously just an example of what could happen, but it illustrates how praying with your imagination can open you up more to allow the Holy Spirit to change your perspective, thus aligning you more with God's will.  \n\n\nWhen we pray without our imagination, we tend to just say words, and these words usually end up being what \nwe\n want God to do.  When we pray with our imagination, we allow ourselves to get a better picture of what \nGod\n wants to do - it somehow opens us up more to the Holy Spirit's promptings.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nWe also heard some good examples of how to use your imagination in prayer.  One neat example was when praying for someone, imagine a huge spot-light beam of light falling down on that person as you pray for them - the spot-light represents the power of your prayer through God falling upon them.  This is actually helping you visualize the reality of your prayer (not that our prayer is like a spot-light on them, but your prayer \nis\n making a kingdom impact).  Seeing it concretely in your mind will give you the passion and energy to pursue it, and helps us push harder with God to help bring about his will in Heaven here on earth.\n\n\nListening to God\n\n\nWe also wrapped up with how using your imagination in prayer makes you more receptive to God communicating back with us.  So many Christians only talk \nto\n God, but never listen for Him.  A main reason is because it is hard to hear Him - but when using our imagination we can \"hear\" his prompting even more.  A concern in this is that we worry that our imagination is just telling ourselves what we want to hear and not actually God - if you hear a word from God, and you can back it up in scripture, trust that it is God talking to you.  We also thought that this part of listening to God with our imagination would take time and practice, but as we deepen our communication with God, it will be more clear what is God and what is our mind.\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\nI was pretty excited after our discussion on Sunday.  I would challenge you guys to try to cut out a few minutes of your (busy!) days to practice this.  \n\n\nWe talked about how even praying for something simple like having a good day tomorrow becomes a totally different prayer when using your imagination.  Instead of saying the words \"Please help me to have a good day tomorrow\", praying for that in your imagination leads you to pray for people you will come into contact with, and to pray a lot more specifically for your day in general.  \n\n\nStay Focused!\n\n\nYour prayers may wander a bit, but that could just be the Holy Spirit directing your prayers!  \n\n\nI think the reason I struggle with a meaningful prayer time is because just saying words is dry and (to be honest) boring.  At first, I wanted to be doing something else rather then setting aside a few minutes to talk with God, but what I have found is that by using my imagination while praying I am way more passionate about it - but also, my prayer time lasts a lot longer than I thought it would, and I can't wait to pray again the next time.\n\n\nNext Week\n\n\nThe plan for next Sunday is to cover 1 Thess. 5:17 - Pray without ceasing!  In the next week or so, try to think about these questions:\n\n\n\n\nWhat draws your attention away from being present with Jesus in every moment of your life?\n\n\nWho in your life or what ways can you remind yourself to be present with Jesus throughout your day?",

This is obviously just an example of what could happen, but it illustrates how praying with your imagination can open you up more to allow the Holy Spirit to change your perspective, thus aligning you more with God's will.    When we pray without our imagination, we tend to just say words, and these words usually end up being what  we  want God to do.  When we pray with our imagination, we allow ourselves to get a better picture of what  God  wants to do - it somehow opens us up more to the Holy Spirit's promptings.",

One neat example was when praying for someone, imagine a huge spot-light beam of light falling down on that person as you pray for them - the spot-light represents the power of your prayer through God falling upon them.  This is actually helping you visualize the reality of your prayer (not that our prayer is like a spot-light on them, but your prayer  is  making a kingdom impact).  Seeing it concretely in your mind will give you the passion and energy to pursue it, and helps us push harder with God to help bring about his will in Heaven here on earth.",

So many Christians only talk  to  God, but never listen for Him.  A main reason is because it is hard to hear Him - but when using our imagination we can \"hear\" his prompting even more.  A concern in this is that we worry that our imagination is just telling ourselves what we want to hear and not actually God - if you hear a word from God, and you can back it up in scripture, trust that it is God talking to you.  We also thought that this part of listening to God with our imagination would take time and practice, but as we deepen our communication with God, it will be more clear what is God and what is our mind.",

            "text": "Prayer #5\n\n\n11/20/2013\n\n\n\n\nHere is the recap from the sermon and our discussion on Sunday:\n\n\nVerses\n\n\nWe started out reading a few verses (\nPsalm 27:4\n, \n1 Corinthians 6:19\n, \n1 Corinthians 3:16\n, \nJohn 15:4\n) that had the theme of God's presence being with us and in us, and followed it up with \n1 Thessalonians 5:16\n (Pray continually).\n\n\nGod's Presence\n\n\nWe talked about God's omnipresence being categorized 2 different ways: God's sustaining presence, and God's Holy presence.  \n\n\nWhen sin entered the world, a division took place here on earth because His Holy presence was blocked out by sin (this was described as secular versus sacred).  God is omnipresent in the way that He sustains everything in existence.  His Holy presence, however, exists more in certain areas than others. \n\n\nIn the Old Testament, His Holy presence was usually centered around the tabernacle or the temple.  In the New Testament, His Holy presence is present when people allow it in their lives.  When we ask God to be the Lord of our life, our \"address\" changes, and we are placed in the center of His Holy presence.  \n\n\nIn addition, Christ also enters us when we are saved.  This means that the moment we asked Jesus into our hearts, there is no longer a distinction between secular and sacred: Any/every place we go is a sacred place, because we are in the middle of His Holy presence.  We don't need to go to church to go to a sacred place, we don't need to go to a special place to pray, we don't even need to set aside specific times to pray, because we are \nalways\n in the presence of God.\n\n\nSpecific Prayer Times\n\n\nA side note on setting aside specific times to pray:  We discussed how it is still important to set aside regular times to meet with God in prayer, but that is not the only time you can pray.  \n\n\nWe compared it to a marriage relationship: It is important for a couple to set aside regular times to spend quality time with each other, but the relationship is not confined to those special times.  We can communicate and build the relationship anytime we are around our spouse.  It's the same with God, only we are \nalways\n in His presence!\n\n\nA commitment\n\n\nWe also heard how when we committed our life to Jesus, it was not just about the pledge we made.  It is not a matter of pledging to live your life for God and then forgetting about it for the rest of your life.  Your life is actually a series of moments strung together.  A commitment to live for God is not a one-time deal - it is a \ncontinual\n surrendering of your life, every moment of every day.\n\n\nFunctional Atheists\n\n\nWe heard the comparison of most christian lives to \"functional atheists\" - which is uncomfortable to hear.  What this means is that while we do have some \"sacred\" times in our lives (when we go to church, pray to God, give thanks for a meal), the majority of our \"normal\" lives are spent without giving God a second thought - much like an atheist would spend their lives.\n\n\nInstead of living like a functional atheist, we are called to abide (remain, stay) in Him, and you will bear fruit.  Abiding with His spirit produces the fruit of the spirit!  We try to produce our own fruit when we are not abiding in Him.\n\n\nPray Continually\n\n\nAll of these thoughts got pulled together and connected for us with the 2-word verse of \n1 Thessalonians 5:16\n - Pray continually.  This sounds pretty impossible, especially in the middle of our busy lives with young children, careers, etc.  How can we pray non-stop?  This goes back to \nJohn 15:4\n where we are called to abide in Him.  It doesn't necessarily mean talking to God non-stop - It is a mindset and an awareness that we are always in His Holy presence.\n\n\nConversations\n\n\nWe heard the example of how we have conversations with ourselves in our head when we think.  This sounds crazy, but if you look at how you process your thoughts, you are having mini conversations with yourself.  To abide in God's presence is to include Him on those conversations in your head.  An added benefit of including God in your ongoing thoughts is that you are making yourself more receptive to hear what God has to say to you.\n\n\nThree Tips\n\n\nThis all still feels daunting and very difficult, so we talked about 3 tips that can help:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine God as your invisible friend who is always right next to you.  (Remember a couple of weeks ago when we talked about imagination, and how imagination is not just used to imagine made up things, but can also be used to bring reality closer?  This is the same thing, because, as this sermon talked about, we are always in the presence of God.  To imagine that He is sitting next to you is just picturing reality!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment with making your thoughts a 3-way conversations.  Include God in every thought process.  Start out with something easy or mindless, like when you are going for a jog.  Make a conscious effort to include God in your thoughts, and see how long you can keep it up.  As you practice this more and more, it will become second nature and you will be abiding in His presence. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup reminders and accountability.  How quickly after we left on Sunday did we go on our way and forget we were in the middle of God's Holy presence?  By giving yourself reminders, and inviting other people to remind you, you can be more aware of God's presence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckpoint\n\n\nSo - how have you been doing on keeping your thoughts in His presence?  I'll be honest - it is hard.  I've been driving to-and-from work without the radio this week to be more conscious of His presence (I'm not saying that I'll never listen to the radio again - it just seemed like a good place to start.  Eventually, when I am dwelling in His presence more often than not, we can have conversations about what we hear on the radio!)  It seems to be getting easier, but I am so conditioned to being in my own thoughts...\n\n\nWork together\n\n\nLike we also mentioned on Sunday, feel free to share tips on what helps you focus on His presence throughout the day.  The term \"functional atheist\" is definitely uncomfortable for me to be compared to, but probably because I know it is somewhat accurate.  By working together as a group to challenge each other, we can help each other move from being less of a functional atheist, and more of a child of God who abides in Him.\n\n\nOne more thing\n\n\nI just wanted to add that while sin is an obstacle to God's presence, and the fact that most of our normal lives are spent not even thinking about God - those don't cancel out what God did on the cross for us.  But by not abiding in His presence, you are missing out on hearing His direction and producing His fruit of the spirit.  \n\n\nI just didn't want it to come across like you aren't saved if you aren't abiding in His presence :)  Abiding in His presence is what the human heart is hungry for, so let's let God fulfill that hunger!",

            "text": "Prayer #6\n\n\n12/7/2013\n\n\nHere is the recap from our study on Sunday:\n\n\nWhat is worship?\n\n\nWe started out by reading some verses in Psalms that talk about how we worship God (lifting our hands, shouting to Him, playing instruments, etc.)  Then we heard a way to think of worship as \"shipping worth\" to God - the actions and thoughts during our worship should be focused on ascribing worth to Him.\n\n\nThe worship time at church on Sundays is more than just a prelude to the sermon.  Just like we talked about with prayer last time - prayer isn't just a once-in-a-while thing... it is a mindset that we should always be in, to pray continuously.  The same goes for worship: It is not just a once-a-week thing - we are to worship God through our thoughts and our actions every moment of every day.  \n\n\nThis does not mean we should be walking around mumbling praises to Him - anything that brings glory to God is a form of worship.  When we choose not to gossip, we are worshiping God.  When we help someone in need, we are worshiping God.  Like we talked about last time about the secular versus the sacred...  When we are living in the sacred, we are worshiping God.\n\n\nSo when we show up for a time of worship on Sunday, we are just transitioning from one form of worship to another form of worship (expressing it through music).\n\n\nBody and Heart\n\n\nThen we talked about how the body and our heart are connected...  the abundance of joy in our heart will (if we don't stop it) be expressed in our body.   What we do with our body, affects our heart, and what goes on in the heart needs to be expressed with our body (through singing, dancing, shouting, clapping, raising hands, etc - all the verses we talked about).\n\n\nDifferent ways to Worship\n\n\nWe talked about the different ways to worship God in music (based on the verses we read at the beginning).  We talked about how sometimes dancing for joy and shouting for joy can seem disrespectful in some churches, but in the context of the verses we read, we saw how they bring glory and ascribe worth to God.  Of course, you wouldn't want to go to the front of a super conservative church and start dancing, because that would totally be a distraction to everyone there.  \n\n\nAlso, we talked about how dancing is so \"tainted\" by society, so to bring it into church sounds sacrilegious.  \n\n\nWe could think of examples, like interpretive dance, where there is no doubt that it is focused on glorifying God.  \n\n\nA lot of us noticed the gentleman in the service about a month ago who was dancing during worship - and every single one of us noted how his movements actually brought us further into worship - his dancing was not secular - it was bursting forth out of a love for God.\n\n\nApplause\n\n\nWe also noted how when we applaud at the end of a song, it is not to congratulate the musicians - but it is to applaud God who made the musicians and the music.  It is a big \"thank you God for being awesome\".\n\n\nBeing free to worship\n\n\nNow, talking about expressing our heart with our body sounds pretty scary to some of us who are more quiet and reserved people.  We talked about how you don't get bonus \"points\" for dancing rather than singing quietly, and how the people who are clapping aren't necessarily closer to God than the people who are hushed in quiet reverence.  \n\n\nWe talked about how different cultures tend to be more vocal and animated during worship, where others tend to be more reverent.  \n\n\nThe point is that you need to be free to worship the way that works for you - worship is all about participation.  \n\n\nWe ascribe worth to God (ship worth to him - worship) by the \nintensity of our focus on Him\n.  When our body is expressing what we are singing, we become more passionate and focused on God.\n\n\nAn Example\n\n\nTo take this a step further - we talked about this example:  If you are in a conversation with someone, but you are looking around, noticing everything around you, not really paying attention to them, you are basically letting that person know that they are not that important to you.  \n\n\nThe same is (even more) true with God.  If you are looking around during worship, looking at other people, maybe judging someone because they smell like smoke or aren't singing - you are not focusing on God, and you are basically saying that everything else in the room is more important than Him.  \n\n\nI'm not trying to say if you ever get distracted during worship that God isn't important to you - but just remember the example of talking to another person.  The more distracted you are, the more you are saying you don't care.  \n\n\nWorship becomes worship when we make a \ndecision\n to block out everything else and to focus everything on the One we are singing to, and what we are singing about.\n\n\nWhere's the passion?\n\n\nOkay - all of that was basically an introduction to worship:  Having a singular focus (body and heart) on God.  Like we have been talking about with prayer - it is very difficult to just sit down and pray some words and feel passionate about it.  The same goes for worship - if all we are doing is just singing the words, it will be dry and we are less likely to focus.  A way to become more passionate about prayer, and now worship, is to use your imagination. \n\n\nImagining worship\n\n\nWhat brings more passion: To sing the words \"The God of angel armies is always by my side. The one who reigns forever - He is a friend of mine\", or to imagine those words are you are singing?  For me, to imagine the truth of those words will \nalways\n bring a passion to my worship rather than just standing there trying to sing the words.  \n\n\nLike we talked about with imagination and prayer - it is not trying to make things up - but it brings reality closer.  \n\n\nWith the lyrics I gave above - imagine God is standing by your side - imagine holding His hand while you sing this song!  That's not far fetched or making something up - like we talked about last time, we are \nalways\n in His presence - so it is not far fetched to imagine Him standing next to us when we sing these words.  \"The one who reigns forever, He is a friend of mine\" - He \nis\n your friend - imagine Him like you imagine a friend.\n\n\nAnother example of a song that makes me imagine in vivid pictures is the hymn \"Holy, Holy, Holy\".  \n\n\n\n\nHoly, holy, holy!\n\nAll the saints adore thee\ncasting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;\ncherubim and seraphim falling down before thee\nwhich wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I am singing this song, it is like I can almost physically see our praises rising up to Him as a sweet perfume.  We are the \"saints\" that are adoring Him, and someday we will cast our golden crowns before Him.  \n\n\nI try to picture what that will look like - how magnificent it will be.  And then to see the heavenly creatures also fall down before Him.  To me, that whole scene is \nexploding\n with worth, streaming up to God.  Like I said, I can almost see it streaming up to Him.\n\n\nThat is just my idea and my representation of those words - others may visualize it differently - but either way, I believe it is visualizing truth.  And, when I am able to visualize the words of a song like that, those are the closest times I feel to God during worship - the passion and focus is definitely there.  Were I just to sing the words, yes, I am still ascribing worth to Him, but I do not think I am as in to it.\n\n\nThe next time you are in the worship part of the service, ask the Holy Spirit to help you envision what you are singing about - it can make the worship time so powerful!\n\n\nWorshiping together\n\n\nI mentioned before that the worship part of the service is not the only time of the week that we worship since our actions should bring glory to God throughout the day.  However, one awesome part of the worship service at church is that we get to experience that worship with other believers.  Also, like I mentioned above, that gentleman who was really into the music helped many people around him focus on God and the worship.  \n\n\nThe next part we talked about is how our focus (or lack of focus) affects those who are worshiping around us.  Not only does our focus on God bring us closer to God, it can help others around us focus more on God.  In a sense, we owe it to the people around us to be focused on God during worship.  Imagine being in the center of a bunch of people who worship God like that gentleman - after a few songs, I think I would be pretty focused on worship, and probably worshiping with a passion that doesn't happen often.  \n\n\nConversely, if you are in the center of a bunch of people who are only singing (if they are even singing) so they can get through the worship part of the service and get to the sermon.  Chances are, those people around you will dampen your worship experience without even knowing it.  \n\n\nI'm not saying that you can't have an intimate time with God in the middle of people who aren't focused on God, but I am saying this:  Who do you want to be?  Do you want to be the person that is so focused on God during worship that without even knowing it, you are causing people to enter into a more passionate time of worship - or - do you want to be the person who doesn't even realize they are causing other people to have a more dry or distracted experience?  That's obviously a rhetorical question, but it definitely makes me think twice about going into the worship service...\n\n\nBasically, the worship time is not just for you, but for all of God's people to come together as one body in worship to Him.\n\n\nDiversity\n\n\nThe last thing we talked about was the diversity in worship.  Obviously people have different likes and dislikes when it comes to music and worship.  We are in a society where everyone wants it our way.  As a believer, it is a sign of maturity when you can still remain focused on God when a song comes up that you don't know or don't like.  \n\n\nIf you always had the songs you liked, you wouldn't grow as much.  Other people may like the song you don't like, and vice-versa.   God's kingdom is for every tribe, every tongue, and every nation.  The point is, worship is supposed to be our undivided attention focused on God - it is not about what we can get out of it - it is not for us, but for God.\n\n\nMy personal note\n\n\nAlso, one personal note I would like to add: The part where we talked about that people worship differently - some quiet and reverent, some raising hands, etc - and how there isn't a right or wrong way.  Personally, I tend to use this a bit as an excuse to stay reserved.  If my heart is so full of joy that I are feeling led to raise my hands in joy, but I don't because I'm quiet and reserved, I am now believing I am blocking myself from being fully involved in worship.  \n\n\nIf I am feeling surrendered to God during a song and am feeling to bow or lift up my hands in surrender to Him, but I don't because I'm afraid what people think of me, again - I think I am not letting myself be fully surrendered to God.  \n\n\nThis is a personal challenge to me, and maybe a challenge to you.  Again - you don't \nneed\n to raise your hands or dance or whatever to get closer to God - but - if you are feeling led to express your worship through your body - I encourage you (and me!) to let go and focus completely on worshiping God - instead of thinking \"I'm more reserved so it's okay if I just stand here\".  I don't think I'm saying it clearly - I don't want it to come across wrong...  \n\n\nI guess what I'm saying is just go where the Spirit leads - blocking those promptings could be inhibiting your ability to worship fully.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nNow that our series is done, I'm planning on writing a summary of all of the studies - hopefully a short email of just some key points.\n\n\nGod bless!",

The worship time at church on Sundays is more than just a prelude to the sermon.  Just like we talked about with prayer last time - prayer isn't just a once-in-a-while thing... it is a mindset that we should always be in, to pray continuously.  The same goes for worship: It is not just a once-a-week thing - we are to worship God through our thoughts and our actions every moment of every day.    This does not mean we should be walking around mumbling praises to Him - anything that brings glory to God is a form of worship.  When we choose not to gossip, we are worshiping God.  When we help someone in need, we are worshiping God.  Like we talked about last time about the secular versus the sacred...  When we are living in the sacred, we are worshiping God.  So when we show up for a time of worship on Sunday, we are just transitioning from one form of worship to another form of worship (expressing it through music).",

Of course, you wouldn't want to go to the front of a super conservative church and start dancing, because that would totally be a distraction to everyone there.    Also, we talked about how dancing is so \"tainted\" by society, so to bring it into church sounds sacrilegious.    We could think of examples, like interpretive dance, where there is no doubt that it is focused on glorifying God.    A lot of us noticed the gentleman in the service about a month ago who was dancing during worship - and every single one of us noted how his movements actually brought us further into worship - his dancing was not secular - it was bursting forth out of a love for God.",

We talked about how different cultures tend to be more vocal and animated during worship, where others tend to be more reverent.    The point is that you need to be free to worship the way that works for you - worship is all about participation.    We ascribe worth to God (ship worth to him - worship) by the  intensity of our focus on Him .  When our body is expressing what we are singing, we become more passionate and focused on God.",

The same is (even more) true with God.  If you are looking around during worship, looking at other people, maybe judging someone because they smell like smoke or aren't singing - you are not focusing on God, and you are basically saying that everything else in the room is more important than Him.    I'm not trying to say if you ever get distracted during worship that God isn't important to you - but just remember the example of talking to another person.  The more distracted you are, the more you are saying you don't care.    Worship becomes worship when we make a  decision  to block out everything else and to focus everything on the One we are singing to, and what we are singing about.",

The one who reigns forever - He is a friend of mine\", or to imagine those words are you are singing?  For me, to imagine the truth of those words will  always  bring a passion to my worship rather than just standing there trying to sing the words.    Like we talked about with imagination and prayer - it is not trying to make things up - but it brings reality closer.    With the lyrics I gave above - imagine God is standing by your side - imagine holding His hand while you sing this song!  That's not far fetched or making something up - like we talked about last time, we are  always  in His presence - so it is not far fetched to imagine Him standing next to us when we sing these words.  \"The one who reigns forever, He is a friend of mine\" - He  is  your friend - imagine Him like you imagine a friend.  Another example of a song that makes me imagine in vivid pictures is the hymn \"Holy, Holy, Holy\".     Holy, holy, holy! \nAll the saints adore thee\ncasting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;\ncherubim and seraphim falling down before thee\nwhich wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.   When I am singing this song, it is like I can almost physically see our praises rising up to Him as a sweet perfume.  We are the \"saints\" that are adoring Him, and someday we will cast our golden crowns before Him.    I try to picture what that will look like - how magnificent it will be.  And then to see the heavenly creatures also fall down before Him.  To me, that whole scene is  exploding  with worth, streaming up to God.  Like I said, I can almost see it streaming up to Him.  That is just my idea and my representation of those words - others may visualize it differently - but either way, I believe it is visualizing truth.  And, when I am able to visualize the words of a song like that, those are the closest times I feel to God during worship - the passion and focus is definitely there.  Were I just to sing the words, yes, I am still ascribing worth to Him, but I do not think I am as in to it.  The next time you are in the worship part of the service, ask the Holy Spirit to help you envision what you are singing about - it can make the worship time so powerful!",

The only problem is that we \nthink\n we have a problem - so we spend all of our time trying to get what He has already given us for free.  The very act of us trying to get it prevents us from experiencing it for free.\"  This has to do with the \"God shaped hole\" we have in our lives.  Basically - the time we spend trying to fill the \"God shaped holes\" in our lives are keeping us from experiencing a full relationship with Him - which is the only thing that can fill the holes in our lives.\n\n\nHearing these words are not enough, though - we need an actual transformation in our lives - and a major way we can experience this transformation is by leaving behind the old names we have been called and embracing the new names God has given us.\n\n\nSignificance of names\n\n\nWe discussed the passage in \nDaniel 1:6-7\n where the king changed the names of the Hebrew captives.  In those days, their names were more than a label - there names were phrases that had significant meaning.  The king changed their names because he knew how powerful a name is to a person, and how he could use their names to bend them.\n\n\nHere are the names of the 4 Hebrews and what they were changed to:\n\n\n\n\nDaniel - God is my Judge \n\nBalshazar - Guarded by Ba'al\n\n\nHananiah - The Lord is gracious\n\nShadrach - Under Aku's command\n\n\nMishael - Who is like God\n\nMeshach - Who is like Sheshach\n\n\nAzariah - The Lord is my helper\n\nAbednego - Slave of Nebo\n\n\n\n\nWe talked about how amazing it would be if your name actually was \"The Lord is my helper\" - if every time someone talked to you, they called you that.  If you heard that over and over, every day of your life.  That would have to impact you.  I'm sure some days, you glaze over it because you heard it so much, but overall, it would have a positive impact on you.\n\n\nThe opposite is true - if you had a bad name, that would be such a negative impact.\n\n\nWe also heard that generally, the person who names someone usually has some authority over the person they are naming.\n\n\nThe summary of this is that names are very powerful, and can be a blessing or a curse in someone's life.\n\n\nOur names\n\n\nIn our society, our names are more labels or social cues.  Some of us know what the meaning of our name is, but it is usually not something we dwell on very often.  However, as we have grown up, we usually give names to ourselves, or others have given us names whether they intended to or not.\n\n\nSome examples of good names people can receive: \"You are a blessing to us\", \"You are loved by God\", \"You are an amazing person\", etc.\nSome example of bad names people get are: \"You are ugly\", \"You are stupid\", \"You can't do anything right\", \"No one likes you\", etc.\n\n\nWe can easily see that if you heard these names (good or bad) over and over, they would definitely impact your life.\n\n\nA new name\n\n\nThe focal point in our discussion was how when we became Christians, God gave us a new name, and we don't have to listen to the our old, bad names any more.  It takes time to learn to respond to a new name.  It takes even more time to stop responding to old ones that are lies about who you are.  But remember that Christ is the Truth, and you are in Christ, therefore in the Truth.  We need to let our \"I am\" names be defined by the Great \"I AM\"!\n\n\nWe also heard that Daniel and his friends probably didn't always live up to their awesome names - but that doesn't mean their names were not valid.  When you mess up, dust yourself off and remember that the sin does not define you - remember who you really are in Jesus.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nThe 3 points we heard in summary were:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart noticing your the names you have been called, especially when you make choices that don't align with God's will.  Don't notice these names to get down on yourself - just to realize that there is a name you have been answering to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop the influence of the bad names, by remembering your true names in Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the old names to serve as a reminder of your new name.  For example, when you hear your old name \"You are stupid, you can't do anything right\" - use that to remember the name God gave you: \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to make your names in Christ a part of your subconscious - dwell on these names, and let the truth sink in.\n\n\nA Challenge\n\n\nAs a wrap up, I challenged all of us to search the Bible for names that God has given you, and share them with the group.\n\n\nHere are the names that I have been finding (I use the NAS translation in case these verses didn't translate the same in other translations):\n\n\n\n\nI am a delight to God - Zephaniah 3:17\n\n\nGod rejoices over \nme\n with shouts of joy! - Zephaniah 3:17\n\n\nI am loved by God - John 3:16\n\n\nGod loves me with an everlasting love - Jeremiah 31:3\n\n\nI am valuable to God - Matthew 10:30-31\n\n\nGod is for me - Romans 8:31\n\n\nI am God's friend - John 15:14\n\n\nI am forgiven - Acts 10:43, Colossians 1:14\n\n\nI am whiter than snow - Psalm 51:7\n\n\nGod pours His love over me - Romans 5:5\n\n\nI am God's handiwork - Ephesians 2:10\n\n\nGod fellowships with me - 1 Corinthians 1:9\n\n\nGod's love for me is boundless - Ephesians 3:17-19\n\n\nI am clothed with Christ - Galatians 3:27\n\n\nGod gives me strength - Isaiah 40:29\n\n\nGod covers me with His hand - Exodus 33:22\n\n\nI am blameless - Colossians 1:22\n\n\nGod draws me near to Him - Hebrews 7:19",

We also heard that Daniel and his friends probably didn't always live up to their awesome names - but that doesn't mean their names were not valid.  When you mess up, dust yourself off and remember that the sin does not define you - remember who you really are in Jesus.",

Don't notice these names to get down on yourself - just to realize that there is a name you have been answering to.    Stop the influence of the bad names, by remembering your true names in Christ.    Use the old names to serve as a reminder of your new name.  For example, when you hear your old name \"You are stupid, you can't do anything right\" - use that to remember the name God gave you: \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me!\"    Try to make your names in Christ a part of your subconscious - dwell on these names, and let the truth sink in.",

            "text": "Love #2\n\n\n2/4/2014\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the summary from the sermon we listened to last Sunday.\n\n\nAs I mentioned, this sermon was loaded with so much good stuff and seemed to have two topics in it, so we split it into two parts.\n\n\nTwo Parts\n\n\nThis past week we covered \"It's All About Love (Part 1)\" which talked about how much God loves us.\nNext week we will cover \"It's All About Love (Part 2)\" which will talk about letting God's love flow out of us into other people.\n\n\nScripture\n\n\nThe scripture that we read was:\n\nJohn 17:19-26\n - the key in this passage was that it showed that God loves us, God's love is \nin\n us, and \nGod\n Himself is in us.\n\n\nJohn 3:16\n - The key word in this familiar passage is \"gave\".  God loved, so He gave.\n\n\n1 John 3:16\n - We know love by this: God laid down His life for us.\n\n\nDefinition of love\n\n\nWe started out by hearing the definition of love at its very basic core: Giving, sacrificing, ascribing worth to someone or something.\n\n\nWe talked about how you can love something to a certain degree - and you can usually tell the degree to which you love someone or something by how much you are willing to sacrifice for them (remember this sentence for later on).\n\n\nLove has limits\n\n\nAn example we heard was the family dog.  The pastor loved the dog enough to pay $30/haircut, and a $300 surgery for his dog.  But when the doctor recommended a $1200 proactive surgery, he drew the line.  \n\n\nThis shows that love has limits.  The flipside of knowing the limits of Love is to realize that God's love has no limits!\n\n\nThen we transitioned to talking about how much God loves us, and how this was important to know.  How can we give God's pure, overflowing love if we do not understand it, or we do not realize we are overflowing with it?\n\n\nHow much does God love you?\n\n\nSo how much \ndoes\n God love you?  Remember back a couple of paragraphs ago to the core of love?  If you can tell the degree to which you love someone by how much you sacrifice for them, what did God sacrifice for you?  \n\n\nThe obvious \"Sunday School\" answer is \"Jesus\" - and that is true.  But the way this sermon described it is amazing:\n\n\n\n\nGod gave His only begotten Son - God became a human.  We are so worth it to Him, that he crossed the infinite gulf that separates God from humanity to live among us.\n\n\nBut that's not all:\n\nHe also allowed Himself to die a nightmarish death on the cross for us.\n\nHe allowed Himself to take on all of the sin of the earth throughout history.\n\nHe allowed Himself to take the punishment for those sins.\n\nHe allowed Himself to experience God forsakenness.\n\nJesus experienced something He had never experienced before: God abandonment and God's judgment.\n\n\n\n\nHe could not have done more than He did for you.  \nHe could not have sacrificed anything more.\n\n\nSo again with the question: If you can tell the degree to which you love someone by how much you sacrifice for them, and knowing that He could not have sacrificed anything more for you, how much does that say about His love for you?\n\n\nHow near are we to God's love?\n\n\nNow that we are beginning to understand the extent of God's love for you, we looked again at the passage from John 17 and how God's love is \nin\n us - and God Himself is in us.\n\n\nThere is perfect love between the trinity - and that is the very same love that is directed at you! (\nJohn 17:26\n - so that the love with which You (God) loved Me (Jesus) may be in them (us!), and I in them).  \n\n\nThis means that as you sit here reading this as a believer, you could not be more the object of God's love than you are right now.  His perfect, complete love can't get any better!  \n\n\nThis is hard to grasp as humans, because as we discussed, we have limits to our love.  God's love, being limitless, cannot increase for you anymore - meaning, it is as high as it can go!\n\n\nThe depth of God's love for you\n\n\nWe discussed this analogy: Picture someone that you consider to love the \nmost\n.  Get an image of them in your mind.  Notice the feelings you have for them.  \n\n\nNow, imagine yourself in their spot (being the object of love), and put God in your spot (the giver of love) - looking at you with the same love - because when He is looking at you with Love, He is looking at Jesus.  \n\n\nThat love you experience for someone is how God loves you - only, multiply it by thousands, millions, billions, trillions.  Can you imagine loving your child any more than you already do?  Multiply that by the biggest number you can imagine, and now you are \nbeginning\n to see how much God loves you...\n\n\nWhen you see yourself being loved by God that way, you are living as God intended it to be when He created humans.  After the fall, we all have a whole in our hearts, and that perfect love of God is the only thing that can fill it.\n\n\nI love you too\n\n\nWe finished up hearing Beth Moore talk about she saw an amazing sunset and was overwhelmed with God's love for her.  She heard God tell her, for a while, don't say \"I love you God\", but to instead say \"I love you too, God\". \n\n\nThe scripture that she related to this experience was \nI John 4:19\n:\n\n\n\n\nWe love, because He first loved us.  \n\n\n\n\nGod is the source of love.  Our ability to love God isn't in us - it comes from God.\n\n\nTransition to Part 2\n\n\nThe love that God has for us is not only towards us, it is in us.  But it doesn't just stay in us - we are conduits of God's love to the people around us.  \n\n\nWe briefly talked about how sometimes it feels like we have to muster up love for the people who aren't very lovable - but in reality, God's love is already overflowing in us - we just have to not block it, and let it flow towards others!\n\n\nBeing recipients of God's love defines who we \nare\n in Christ.  Being conduits of God's love defines what we \ndo\n in Christ.\n\n\nWrap up\n\n\nWe had such an amazing discussion of this amazing material.  It is hard to imagine how deep God loves us, but once we start realizing this, the abundance of love will be flowing out of us like crazy!  This is why we had the \"assignment\" to be aware of God's love for you this week, and to share it with the group... Be aware of it!  Experience His crazy love for you!  Dwell on it as often as possible!\n\n\nI'm so excited to get into Part 2 with you guys where we talk about loving others!\n\n\nHave a blessed week!",

We aren't just recipients of God's love (that is who we are), we are replicators and conduits of God's love (that is what we do).\n\n\nThree parts of love\n\n\nI accidentally skipped a clip, so I will summarize what was in that clip here:\n\n\nThere are 3 parts to God's love: \n\n His love flowing to us\n\n His love dwelling in us\n* His love flowing through us.  \n\n\nThose 3 parts must be together - you can't separate them.  Because of His love in us, there should be 3 results in our life: We reflect that love back to God (worship), we affirm our own worth in God, and we affirm the worth of others.  These three things are inseparable as well - you can't do one without doing the others.  \n\n\n\n\nIf anyone says they love God but don't love their neighbor, they are a liar.\n\n\n\n\nA side note on affirming your own worth in God:  The Bible is not against self-love.  Love your neighbor as \nyourself\n.  You affirm the worth you have because of who God is.\n\n\nThe greatest commandment\n\n\nMatthew 22:36-39\n - when someone asked Jesus what the greatest commandment was, Jesus gave 2 commandments, because you can't do one without the other.  Love God with all your heart AND love your neighbor as yourself.  This is the central thing the Christian life is supposed to be about.\n\n\nAbove all\n\n\n1 John 4:21\n:\n\n\n\n\nAnd this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also.\n\n\n\n\n1 Corinthians 16:14\n: \n\n\n\n\nLet all that you do be done in love.\n\n\n\n\nColossians 3:14a\n: \n\n\n\n\nBeyond all these things put on love\n\n\n\n\n1 Peter 4:8\n: \n\n\n\n\nAbove all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.\n\n\n\n\nGalatians 5:14\n: \n\n\n\n\nFor the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nAn analogy\n\n\nThe analogy we heard was to think about clothing yourself with love like you would wear clothes.  None of us would go to work, church, school, the store, etc without wearing our clothes.  We don't even have to think about it, right?  \"Wearing\" love should be just like that.\n\nWe don't have to wonder, \"Should I be loving in this situation?\" - the answer is always yes!  \n\n\nThis is a given: \nlove continually.\n\n\nLove continually\n\n\nWe also talked about that if we can do this (love all the time), everything else will fall into place.  Gossip, stealing, etc - if your goal is to love others ALL the time, it will be impossible to gossip, steal, etc.  Love all the time, and everything falls into place, but the opposite is true: don't love all the time, and you will struggle with all the other things.\n\n\nAnything without love is worthless\n\n\nThis sounds really harsh.  But look at the familiar passage of \n1 Corinthians 13:1-3\n:\n\n\n\n\nIf I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.\n\n\nIf I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. \n\n\nAnd if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.\n\n\n\n\nHere is what Paul says about your actions if they are not backed up with love - your actions are: A noisy gong, a clanging symbol, worth nothing.\n\n\nAll of those actions can be great, and they may look really good, but if they aren't founded in love, they are nothing.\n\n\nActions without love can be dangerous\n\n\nWe discussed how sometimes Christians or churches can put certain principles or actions above love.  These things can look very good, but if they aren't done in love, they can be evil.  \n\n\nThis is not saying to ignore any parts of the Bible that don't deal with love - but if you take things from the Bible and put them above love, you use it loving some of the time (when people agree with you), but it also can be used to hurt (especially when people don't agree with you).  \n\n\nEven the devil can quote the Bible, but he doesn't do it in love.\n\n\nOur small group\n\n\nWe also heard how a church can have the best programs, give the best sermons, have the best music, but if the end product isn't people who live in an outrageous, radical, ridiculous love, all of those good things aren't worth it.  \n\n\nI related this to our group.  I desperately want our group to be founded in love so that as we go out from our group, God's love is carried out to those around us - maybe not even intentionally, but that people around us would constantly be affected by God's love flowing through us.\n\n\nStay awake\n\n\nStay awake to the love God has given you.  As you live your life and encounter people, ask this question to yourself about every person you are around: \n\n\n\n\nHow can I affirm the infinite worth of this person for whom Christ died?\n\n\n\n\nThis person has infinite value to God!\n\n\nDiffering situations\n\n\nSharing love with people will look different in each situation:  You will show love to your kids differently than you would show love to someone at the store.  \n\n\nAnd as we discussed, maybe it isn't even about an action.  You don't necessarily need to go out of your way to give love to every person around you.  Maybe when everyone is giving a smoker a dirty look when they walk by, you smile at them.  When everyone is staring at the parent of the kid throwing a tantrum, maybe you just go about your business like nothing is bothering you.  That simple act of not judging them can be showing love to them.\n\n\nThe point is: you can always show love, and you should never not show love (see all the verses above).  \n\n\nTough situations\n\n\nWe had discussion about how sometimes it can require God's wisdom on how to show love in certain situations: discipline, being a manager of employees, etc. \n\n\nSometimes it can feel unloving to correct someone, but just think about them as being infinitely loved by God, and think about how you can correct someone in a loving manner.  In a few weeks, we will go into this in more detail.\n\n\nWhen we don't live in love\n\n\nThis whole discussion was centered around love, and how God commands us, above all things, all the time to Love.  \n\n\nWhen I actually think about this as a command from God, and then think about how often I have not done this, I realize how often I have disobeyed God's greatest commandment...  \n\n\nThe redeeming part of this, though, is that God saved us with His grace, and he still pours his outrageous love on us, just waiting for us to share it with others.\n\n\nA challenge\n\n\nThink of one person that you know you don't show love.  Maybe you don't hate them, but you definitely haven't ascribed to them the infinite worth they have in God.  \n\n\nPray that God would help you speak, act, and think about this person in love.  \n\n\nMaybe you still feel yucky about them - maybe they have hurt you... but like the verse above, love is so powerful it can cover a multitude of sins.  Also pray for forgiveness for all the times you did not love this person.\n\n\nMy personal challenge\n\n\nWe didn't discuss this on Sunday, but I would like to take this a step further.  I would like to issue myself a personal challenge:  When I see how incredibly important it is for us to live in love, and how everything we do must be done in love, I want to change the way I live.  This is going to be my focus during this series we are doing as a small group, and I am praying my life will be changed as a result.  \n\n\nI want my life to change to the point where love becomes so embedded that I don't even have to think intentionally about loving someone.  I want to clothe myself in love.  I commit to you guys that I will work on being more intentional about living in love.  I know it will be hard at first and I know I will fail, but I can't wait until it is a natural part of my daily life.  \n\n\nAs my closest group of spiritual friends, I give you permission to keep me accountable, and to challenge me when you see me not acting in a way that is loving.\n\n\nI'm not sharing this challenge to force you into anything.  Like I shared on Sunday, my prayer and vision for the group is that we become a group of love, where love comes pouring out of us.  This personal challenge is the first step for me.\n\n\nMy intent in sharing my personal challenge is to look to you guys for support and to encourage you guys to always be growing.  \n\n\nBe honest with God and stretch yourself to grow a little bit at a time.  If you feel like God is laying an area on your heart where you could grow, and want accountability, what better group of people than our small group to share it with and ask for help.  \n\n\nOnly you know where you stand with God, and maybe you need to just dwell on the first two lessons we covered about knowing your name in Christ, and learning more about how God loves you.  \n\n\nMaybe you are already really good at loving those around you and you can be a support for the rest of the group.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nYou guys are awesome - I thoroughly enjoy working through this stuff with you all, and having the conversations we are able to have together.\n\n\nHave a blessed week!",

I thought it was an awesome analogy and had to share it with you - this is my paraphrase from memory, so hopefully I do it justice:\n\n\nLet's make up a new carnival game, where the object of the game is to throw a ball and knock over fuzzy little stuffed animals (that are, of course, ridiculously hard to knock over).  In the center of all the fuzzy animals is a fuzzy bear - the only bear out of all the other stuffed animals.\n\n\nHere is the rule: The only way to win a prize in this game is to knock over the bear.  In fact, if you are able to knock over the bear, you get \nall\n of the prizes in the booth!  If you knock over any of the other animals, it doesn't count for anything - you don't win any prizes.\n\n\nSo here is the (obvious) question: If you were playing this carnival game, which animal would you spend all of your time trying to knock over?  What would you spend all of your time on - what would your focus be?\n\n\nI'm sure you already see the analogy with what we discussed about love.  If the Bible says, \"Above all, above everything else, love\", what should we focus on?  We can spend our time trying to knock over the other \"animals\" of donating stuff to the poor, giving generously, etc, but if we don't do it in love, it wasn't worth it.  Sure, it looks impressive if I'm zoned in and can knock over animal after animal in that game - Wow!  Nice shot!  Great aim!  You really know how to knock those animals over!  But if I didn't knock over the bear - big deal, right? \n\n\nJust like \n1 Corinthians 13:1-3\n says - I can fathom all mysteries and knowledge, give \nall\n of my possessions to the poor, have faith to move mountains - Wow!  Nice Job!  You really are a model Christian - just look what you can do!  But then the passage finishes with: But if I do not have love, I gain nothing, I am nothing, I am a clanging cymbal - it's just religious noise.\n\n\nThose other things are important and good, yes - but first, we need to work on love: living love, being clothed in love, doing everything in love.  Once we do everything in love - imagine the effectiveness of our actions - imagine the glory that goes to God!\n\n\nHave a great weekend - I can't wait to meet on Sunday!",

So here is the (obvious) question: If you were playing this carnival game, which animal would you spend all of your time trying to knock over?  What would you spend all of your time on - what would your focus be?  I'm sure you already see the analogy with what we discussed about love.  If the Bible says, \"Above all, above everything else, love\", what should we focus on?  We can spend our time trying to knock over the other \"animals\" of donating stuff to the poor, giving generously, etc, but if we don't do it in love, it wasn't worth it.  Sure, it looks impressive if I'm zoned in and can knock over animal after animal in that game - Wow!  Nice shot!  Great aim!  You really know how to knock those animals over!  But if I didn't knock over the bear - big deal, right?   Just like  1 Corinthians 13:1-3  says - I can fathom all mysteries and knowledge, give  all  of my possessions to the poor, have faith to move mountains - Wow!  Nice Job!  You really are a model Christian - just look what you can do!  But then the passage finishes with: But if I do not have love, I gain nothing, I am nothing, I am a clanging cymbal - it's just religious noise.  Those other things are important and good, yes - but first, we need to work on love: living love, being clothed in love, doing everything in love.  Once we do everything in love - imagine the effectiveness of our actions - imagine the glory that goes to God!  Have a great weekend - I can't wait to meet on Sunday!",

The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.\n\n\n\n\nIntro\n\n\nWe have been reviewing a lot about how important love is \u2013 and it is very familiar to many of us.  But that is the problem: We have known these verses for most of our lives, so when we hear it again, we don\u2019t really hear it.  We know it, but we don\u2019t really know it.  \n\n\nAs we study this \u2013 \npretend you don\u2019t know anything about love.\n\n\nThe center of a christian\n\n\nWhat would be the first thing people think of when they think of Christians?\n\n\nThere would probably be some good things, probably a lot of negative things.  But how many people would immediately think of the word \u201clove\u201d?\n\n\nIf there is any one thing we are to impress upon the world, it is love \u2013 God\u2019s love.\n\n\nThe central mark of the believer is to abide in God\u2019s love, let God\u2019s love abide in you, and overflow that love to others.  That is what it means to be a Christian!\n\n\nHow should we love others?  As Christ loved us.\n\n\nWhy should we love? \nJohn 17:21\n \u2013 so that the world may know that God sent Jesus to love them.\n\n\nThe other things in the Christian life are great \u2013 but if love isn\u2019t first place, they don\u2019t even matter.\n\n\nThere is no bigger indictment on the church than when people have to be protected from the church.\n\n\nThe place of love\n\n\nAbiding in God \u2013 the center.  The place that should be our home.  We don\u2019t live there all the time, but we need to remember that it is our home.\n\n\nWhen you live in this place, you begin to see others as God sees them, you begin to ascribe worth to people as God does.  You begin to take on God\u2019s heart when you live in this place.\n\n\nThis place is love.  All of the judgment and \u201cpollution\u201d that is in our mind goes away when we are in this place.  Even if you dislike someone \u2013 even if you think they are immoral \u2013 in this place, those thoughts come to an end because that is not your job description.  In this place, the only thing on your mind is the infinite worth of this person.  What you see is love, what you think about is love \u2013 because that is our only job description.\n\n\nIn this place is joy itself!  To abide in God is to take residence in God \u2013 and that is to take residence in love.  You see everyone through the eyes of Jesus, and you become free from yourself.\n\n\nThe goal of this study is to move our residence to this place.\n\n\nThe only thing that matters\n\n\nGalatians 5:6\n:\n\n\n\n\nFor in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.\n\n\n\n\nThe Galatians (like many Christians today) put too much worth on extra things, like circumcision.  God gave us grace \u2013 and through that grace, we are saved.  \n\n\nThe Galatians (and many Christians today) say \u201cgrace plus X equals what really matters.\"  Sure, we have grace, but we also need this or that to improve our standing with Christ.\n\n\nIn [Galatians 5:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A6\nversion=NIV, Paul is saying that all of those other things don\u2019t matter.  \u201cThe only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.\u201d  When you take grace and add anything to it, it is no longer grace.\n\n\nHow can we try to increase our worth to God when it can\u2019t be surpassed?\n\n\nFaith through love\n\n\nFaith being manifested through love:  Faith that we believe who we are in Christ and faith to believe that the people around you have unsurpassable worth in Christ.  When we really believe this, we act on it.  Faith without works (actions) is dead.  This is why the only thing that matters is love.\n\n\nThe energy of faith is love.  The thing that makes faith work is love. Faith, by itself, if it has no works, is dead (\nJames 2:26\n).  This is not saying we need to add works in order to have faith.  What it is saying that faith that isn\u2019t dead, works.  It has energy to it.  The energy of faith is love.  When you ascribe unsurpassable worth to someone, you do something about it.\n\n\nThis is why love needs to be in first place.\n\n\nBalancing love with judgment\n\n\nSome people think that you can\u2019t just focus on love - People will never overcome their sins if you don\u2019t hold them accountable for those sins.  There is a place to confront sin \u2013 when people have asked you to keep them accountable, or you are in strong, Christian relationship with them.  But judgment does not empower someone to overcome sin \u2013 it condemns them.  \n\n\nLove is what gives someone power to overcome the sin in their life.\n\n\nBeing blessed\n\n\nChristians often pray to be blessed by God, which is a good thing - the intention is good.  But the best way you can get blessed, is to start blessing on others: You pray for blessings on others, you get blessed.  You help others, you get helped.  You give to others, you get.  When you stop looking for advantages for yourself, and start trying to give to others, it all comes back to you.\n\n\nGod bless!",

The importance of this is that in the paradise that God wants for us, there is a provision and a prohibition at the center.  The provision is the tree of life - God will meet our needs.  The prohibition is a boundary: leave to God what belongs to God (in this case, the knowledge of good and evil).\n\n\nGod's job is to judge good and evil - Our job is to reflect God's love to others.\n\n\nThe center\n\n\nWhen Eve at the fruit, she put her own will at the center of her life, and everything revolved around her.  The same goes with us after the fall: we are the center of our existence - we see the world through our own eyes.  \n\n\nWhen we put ourselves at the center, we cut ourselves off from the source of our life, and we try to get that life from everything around us.  We live our lives out of hunger rather than fullness.  When we try to meet our own needs, we bring in our knowledge of good and evil, and evaluate things and people around us by judging them.  \n\n\nExample: Do I like this kind of food, do I not like it.  Do I agree with that person, do I disagree with them.  Do I like that, do I dislike it?  \nWe evaluate everything around us.\n\n\nWe have a perpetual commentary of judgement in our minds that we were never meant to have.  And all of these judgmental thoughts chokes off the one thing we were called to do: love.\n\n\nGod is able to love and judge at the same time - but we are not able to do this, which is why he prohibited it.\n\n\nGood judgement - Discernment\n\n\nThere is a time for routine judgement (analyzing things that could be dangerous), and there can even be a time to use our knowledge of good an evil to help Christian brothers.  If you are in an accountability relationship with someone who has invited you to let them know when they do things not consistent with God, that is a time where you can provide input.  But if the person has not invited you to do this, our job is to love them.\n\n\nAny other judging that we do is simply a way of feeding ourselves - making you feel better about yourself.  You are drinking from a tree you were never made to drink of.\n\n\nWhat we know and don't know\n\n\nOne quote we heard a few times during our study was, \"You need to know what you know, and know what you don't know\". \n\n\nKnow what you know\n:  we know that God is in control, so we need to trust Him on everything else.  We know God didn't intend for us to have the knowledge of good and evil, so leave that up to Him.\n\n\nKnow what you don't know\n:   You don't know the big picture, so let God handle it.  You don't know the situation of the person you want to judge, so don't judge them!  When we judge someone, you are acting like you have all of the information (which you don't - but God does).\n\n\nExcuses!\n\n\nAnother good point we talked about: We are very good at excusing our own behavior (the kids kept me up late, things are real stressful at work, etc), but we rarely try to explain other people's behavior - we usually just snap to a judgement about them.\n\n\nThe cross of Jesus\n\n\nWe also heard the statement that our life could be governed by this mentality: learning to see God, see ourselves, and see others through the cross of Jesus (the love that He gave on the cross could not have been any more perfect).  \n\n\nWhen this view gets blocked, we start to get our life by questioning others, questioning ourselves, and questioning God.  When that happens, we don't go to God to get life, and when we aren't receiving that life and love from God, we can't give it to others.\n\n\nDon't block the flow\n\n\nAll of the above illustrates how judgment starts to block out the flow of God's love in our lives, and certainly blocks us from letting God's love flow to others.  \n\n\nNote\n - \nI'm not saying that God's love stops flowing to us when we live in judgement - I'm just saying that we aren't getting our life from that love.  Just like the sun is always shining even though we might not always feel it\n.\n\n\nA Challenge\n\n\n\n\nSpend time getting rooted and grounded in God's love.  It takes time - set aside time to drink of God's love for you.  Let God love on you.\n\n\nTry to practice being in the presence of God at all times.  Remember that in every moment, God's perfect love is being directed at you!  But also remember that His love is directed at the people around you.\n\n\n\n\nAbide in God's love!",

In preparing this recap, I feel it really goes along well with the Easter season.\n\n\nI really enjoyed our discussion on Sunday.  I know the sermon clips were a bit shorter this time, but the discussion we had was great. \n\n\nMy Background\n\n\nAs I shared on Sunday, when I originally heard this sermon it really touched me because of my shallow relationship with God.  I was nearly perfect on the outside, but as the sermon showed - the outward actions aren't what bring you closer to God.  \n\n\nWhen we have an honest relationship with God, the outward actions are a result.  I was using my knowledge of good and evil to dictate how I lived my life instead of living in a relationship with God.\n\n\nThe knowledge of good and evil\n\n\nWe heard in the sermon how when you live in that knowledge of good and evil, you constantly evaluate each situation to know how to respond: What would be the Christian thing to say, what would be the godly way to respond, what's the exact \"right\" prayer I should pray at this point, etc.  \n\n\nYour life and your worth hang on your ability to perform \"correctly\".  Technically, this type of behavior looks good and right, but there is a quality of life missing, a joy that is missing, a freedom that is missing when people live this way rather than out of a relationship with God.\n\n\nThere was a story in the sermon that illustrated this perfectly (it was just way too long to include on Sunday).  I will send the story next week.\n\n\nPeople who live this way (like I was) think that living religiously \nis\n the relationship with God, but it isn't.  Because they are so wrapped up in correct behavior, when they don't exhibit correct behavior, they feel indicted, and compensate by minimizing their own sin, and trying to maximize the sins of the people around them.  \n\n\nBecause they get life from their system of right-ness, it looks like they have a relationship with God - but in fact, they are hiding behind a wall they create, which prevents them from actually having a good relationship with God.  They hide, just like Adam and Eve did after eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\n\n\nGod loves you anyways\n\n\nWe then heard how all of this type of behavior is a result of not trusting God.  Not trusting that God is big enough to love you \nas you are\n.  Not trusting that God truly loves the people around you.  But what God wants us to see is the truth of He is, revealed in the cross of Jesus.\n\n\nGod wants you because He is in love with you and Jesus died for you - not a perfect you, not a technically correct you, but the real you.\n\n\nNo more performing\n\n\nQuit evaluating yourself and others - that's the curse of the forbidden tree.  Get out of your performing and get into a relationship with God.  Own up to who you are:  You are guilty - but Jesus died for you \nas you are\n and wants to love you and heal you.  Actually, you are even more guilty than you think you are, but He still loves you anyways.  \n\n\nPlus, God knows you better than you know yourself:  Do you think he doesn't know what you have done or how you are living?  But Jesus dieing on the cross is a testimony of how much God loves you.  \n\n\nRemember our study a couple of months ago about how much God loves you?  He gave everything - he couldn't have given anything more - to show you how much He loves you.\n\n\nHonesty\n\n\nWill you trust God enough to be honest with Him?  Give Him your heart - don't justify or excuse it - admit it because Jesus has already \nexperienced\n every sin you have committed as He hung on the cross.  He loves you anyways, and died for you \njust as you are\n.  His mercy is \nfar\n bigger than any of your sins.  \n\n\nIf you doubt this, let the nail marks in his hands and His pierced sides be proof to you.  Let His cries of grief as he took your sin upon Himself be proof to you that His mercy is bigger than those sins.  He is safe - be honest and real with Him.  \n\n\nOnce you do this, you can begin to discover the kind of love that God is and let Him change you from the inside out.\n\n\nJesus as our defender\n\n\nWe then heard the analogy of a defense lawyer.  We are guilty of our sins, but Jesus is our defense lawyer \n\n\n1 John 2:1-2\n (NIV): \n\n\n\n\nMy dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father\u2014Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.\n\n\n\n\nJesus, the defense lawyer, has never lost a case - every single person He represents is found to be innocent (Isaiah 1:18 NIV: \"Come now, let us settle the matter,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cThough your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.\")\n\n\nIn fact, every person is not only found to be innocent, but also comes back as already \"serving the time\" for their actions - the punishment is already complete. \n\n\n2 Corinthians 5:21\n (NIV): \n\n\n\n\nGod made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\n\n\n\n\nJesus does this by being outrageously loving - he has a love relationship with you, the defendant.  It turns out that Jesus is also the judge on the case.\n\n\n2 Corinthians 5:10\n (NIV): \n\n\n\n\nFor we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.\n\n\n\n\nThat is how He wins every case.  \n\n\nThe point of the analogy was not to relate Jesus to a legal trial, although it illustrates it well.  \n\n\nThe point is how much Jesus loves you.  \n\n\nHe doesn't want you to try to be something you are not.  Go to Him as you are.  Be honest with Him, and don't hide from Him like Adam and Eve did.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nOnce you \"give in\" to Him, you begin to discover your relationship with Him is not centered on what you are \ndoing\n, but it is centered on your \nbeing\n.  \n\n\nWhen you let God love you this way, you begin to be transformed from the inside out.  You begin to do the right things out of God's love, not out of an obligation of how you are \"supposed\" to act.\n\n\nIt's all about the infinite love of God toward you - the infinite worth God ascribes to you. Live in that - get your life from that.  Stop getting your life from behaving the \"right\" way.\n\n\nI'll leave with a quote from one of the clips we heard:\n\n\n\n\nJesus died on the cursed tree to free you from the curse of the forbidden tree.\n\n\n\n\nHave a great Easter weekend - He is risen indeed!",

Jesus, the defense lawyer, has never lost a case - every single person He represents is found to be innocent (Isaiah 1:18 NIV: \"Come now, let us settle the matter,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cThough your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.\")  In fact, every person is not only found to be innocent, but also comes back as already \"serving the time\" for their actions - the punishment is already complete.   2 Corinthians 5:21  (NIV):    God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.   Jesus does this by being outrageously loving - he has a love relationship with you, the defendant.  It turns out that Jesus is also the judge on the case.  2 Corinthians 5:10  (NIV):    For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.   That is how He wins every case.    The point of the analogy was not to relate Jesus to a legal trial, although it illustrates it well.    The point is how much Jesus loves you.    He doesn't want you to try to be something you are not.  Go to Him as you are.  Be honest with Him, and don't hide from Him like Adam and Eve did.",

It's all about the infinite love of God toward you - the infinite worth God ascribes to you. Live in that - get your life from that.  Stop getting your life from behaving the \"right\" way.

Next time we meet we will have a question/answer time - I have some Q\nA sessions from the sermon series we covered and we also thought it would be neat if we came up with some questions and try to answer them as a group.  We will send more info on that later.\n\n\nThe theme of the sermon that we listened to on Sunday was basically that love is a choice and is not tied to our emotions.\n\n\nA reminder\n\n\nWe started out with the reminder that everyone has infinite value to God.  God is love (I John 4:8) and he created us out of that love, in order to have a love relationship with us.  When we interact with people, we need to remember that God created \nthem\n out of love too!\n\n\nA description of love\n\n\nWe also heard a really good description of love: Love is not doing what makes you feel good, it is doing what \nis\n good in spite of how you feel.\n\n\nLove listens to your feelings but then involves a choice from your heart.\n\n\nCompelled by love\n\n\nIn 2 Corinthians 5:14-15, it says that Christ's love compels us.  This doesn't mean that God's love forces us to walk around loving everyone.  It means that God's amazing love should be the driving force behind our actions.\n\n\nAn analogy\n\n\nThen we heard an analogy that gave a good example of how love is a choice.  We compared our emotions to a thermometer where they go up and down with the environment around us.  Our emotions are not bad, and we should listen to our emotions to help us make good choices.  But we cannot command our emotions (we can command our choices) - Just like a thermometer cannot command the temperature to go up or down.\n\n\nLove, and our choice to love, is like a thermostat.  A thermostat \nchooses\n to set the temperature.  It works with the furnace to raise the temperature in a room/building.  \n\n\nThis is like our choice to love: it is a choice to work with God to raise the \"temperature\" of love in our environment around us.  We need to make the choice to work with God to be counter-cultural by loving those around us, even if the world says they don't deserve it.\n\n\nChoosing to love\n\n\nGod calls us to love because God is love. This seems difficult, because how can a person feel love all the time? \n\n\nThis is where choice comes in: We can choose love regardless of how we feel.  \n\n\nWe talked about how it is not about faking it.  We can truly be hurt by a person, and yet choose to respond in a way that is consistent with God's love.  We don't need to condone someone's behavior, but we are commanded to make the choice to love them anyways.  \n\n\n(Like Jesus told the early Christians to love their enemies - at that period in time, the enemies of the Christians would burn them alive and many other cruel things).\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nDoing everything in love is the greatest commandment that we receive from Jesus. It is also one of the most difficult. Commanding our choices is essential to loving others, and we shouldn't let our emotions decide our choices. \n\n\nOur emotions can play a part and give us information on a situation, but we should always reflect what our intellect and faith tell us to do as well. \n\n\nIn this way, we can choose to clothe ourselves in love.\n\n\nHave a blessed week!",
