*February 18, 2018*

## Introduction

### Reasons people leave their faith:

* Some think there are problems with the Bible
* Some think science and evolution are not compatible with being a Christian
* Some do not like the concept of hell

We want our faith to be able to stand up to scrutiny

Equip ourselves and our kids on how to respond to objections to Christianity

## What is Truth?

[John 18:33-38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+18%3A33-38&version=NLT)

People today are in a crisis of truth

### Some history

* 1500-1600s - Christian vs Christian wars
* The church tried to end these wars which began the beginning tolerance in western cultures
* Tolerance has been growing in the last 100 years (especially the last 30)
* It is easy to believe your way is right when you are never challenged
* Then it becomes easy to wonder if what you belive is just a product of your environment/culture
* This all leads to the conclusion that we can't talk absolute truth - only "your" truth
