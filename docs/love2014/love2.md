# Love #2
*2/4/2014*

<!-- It's all about love part 1 -->

 Here is the summary from the sermon we listened to last Sunday.

As I mentioned, this sermon was loaded with so much good stuff and seemed to have two topics in it, so we split it into two parts.

## Two Parts
This past week we covered "It's All About Love (Part 1)" which talked about how much God loves us.
Next week we will cover "It's All About Love (Part 2)" which will talk about letting God's love flow out of us into other people.

## Scripture
The scripture that we read was:
[John 17:19-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17%3A19-26&version=NASB) - the key in this passage was that it showed that God loves us, God's love is *in* us, and *God* Himself is in us.

[John 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=NASB) - The key word in this familiar passage is "gave".  God loved, so He gave.

[1 John 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A16&version=NASB) - We know love by this: God laid down His life for us.

## Definition of love
We started out by hearing the definition of love at its very basic core: Giving, sacrificing, ascribing worth to someone or something.

We talked about how you can love something to a certain degree - and you can usually tell the degree to which you love someone or something by how much you are willing to sacrifice for them (remember this sentence for later on).

## Love has limits
An example we heard was the family dog.  The pastor loved the dog enough to pay $30/haircut, and a $300 surgery for his dog.  But when the doctor recommended a $1200 proactive surgery, he drew the line.  

This shows that love has limits.  The flipside of knowing the limits of Love is to realize that God's love has no limits!

Then we transitioned to talking about how much God loves us, and how this was important to know.  How can we give God's pure, overflowing love if we do not understand it, or we do not realize we are overflowing with it?

## How much does God love you?

So how much *does* God love you?  Remember back a couple of paragraphs ago to the core of love?  If you can tell the degree to which you love someone by how much you sacrifice for them, what did God sacrifice for you?  

The obvious "Sunday School" answer is "Jesus" - and that is true.  But the way this sermon described it is amazing:

> God gave His only begotten Son - God became a human.  We are so worth it to Him, that he crossed the infinite gulf that separates God from humanity to live among us.
>
> But that's not all:<br />
> He also allowed Himself to die a nightmarish death on the cross for us.<br />
> He allowed Himself to take on all of the sin of the earth throughout history.<br />
> He allowed Himself to take the punishment for those sins.<br />
> He allowed Himself to experience God forsakenness.<br />
> Jesus experienced something He had never experienced before: God abandonment and God's judgment.<br />

He could not have done more than He did for you.  *He could not have sacrificed anything more.*

So again with the question: If you can tell the degree to which you love someone by how much you sacrifice for them, and knowing that He could not have sacrificed anything more for you, how much does that say about His love for you?

## How near are we to God's love?
Now that we are beginning to understand the extent of God's love for you, we looked again at the passage from John 17 and how God's love is *in* us - and God Himself is in us.

There is perfect love between the trinity - and that is the very same love that is directed at you! ([John 17:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17%3A26&version=NASB) - so that the love with which You (God) loved Me (Jesus) may be in them (us!), and I in them).  

This means that as you sit here reading this as a believer, you could not be more the object of God's love than you are right now.  His perfect, complete love can't get any better!  

This is hard to grasp as humans, because as we discussed, we have limits to our love.  God's love, being limitless, cannot increase for you anymore - meaning, it is as high as it can go!

## The depth of God's love for you
We discussed this analogy: Picture someone that you consider to love the *most*.  Get an image of them in your mind.  Notice the feelings you have for them.  

Now, imagine yourself in their spot (being the object of love), and put God in your spot (the giver of love) - looking at you with the same love - because when He is looking at you with Love, He is looking at Jesus.  

That love you experience for someone is how God loves you - only, multiply it by thousands, millions, billions, trillions.  Can you imagine loving your child any more than you already do?  Multiply that by the biggest number you can imagine, and now you are *beginning* to see how much God loves you...

When you see yourself being loved by God that way, you are living as God intended it to be when He created humans.  After the fall, we all have a whole in our hearts, and that perfect love of God is the only thing that can fill it.

## I love you too
We finished up hearing Beth Moore talk about she saw an amazing sunset and was overwhelmed with God's love for her.  She heard God tell her, for a while, don't say "I love you God", but to instead say "I love you too, God". 

The scripture that she related to this experience was [I John 4:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I+John+4%3A19&version=NASB):

> We love, because He first loved us.  

God is the source of love.  Our ability to love God isn't in us - it comes from God.

## Transition to Part 2
The love that God has for us is not only towards us, it is in us.  But it doesn't just stay in us - we are conduits of God's love to the people around us.  

We briefly talked about how sometimes it feels like we have to muster up love for the people who aren't very lovable - but in reality, God's love is already overflowing in us - we just have to not block it, and let it flow towards others!

Being recipients of God's love defines who we *are* in Christ.  Being conduits of God's love defines what we *do* in Christ.

## Wrap up
We had such an amazing discussion of this amazing material.  It is hard to imagine how deep God loves us, but once we start realizing this, the abundance of love will be flowing out of us like crazy!  This is why we had the "assignment" to be aware of God's love for you this week, and to share it with the group... Be aware of it!  Experience His crazy love for you!  Dwell on it as often as possible!

I'm so excited to get into Part 2 with you guys where we talk about loving others!

Have a blessed week!
