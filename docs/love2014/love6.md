# Love #6
*3/8/2014*

Here is the recap from our last discussion:

## Intro

We started out asking the question:  

> What keeps us from fully experiencing God's love for us?

Until we understand what keeps us from receiving God’s love, we will never be able to freely give His love.


Satan made Eve think she wasn’t full when she already was.  Satan deceives us into spending our life and identity trying to get what God has already given us for free.


## Life in Christ – it is about your being
We contrasted: 

* Life in Christ: Loved for who you **are**
* Life in the flesh: You *think* you are loved for what you **do**

We get so addicted to our *doing* that we have a hard time imagining what it would be like to be loved for free – and ironically, all of our doing is what keeps us from experiencing the fact that we are loved for free.

## Getting worth from our actions

In the flesh, you feel good about yourself by what you do - but your worth goes down when you don’t do the right thing.  You try to acquire worth.

In Christ, all that we do should be about expressing who we already are.

## Life in Christ vs Life in the flesh

The person living in the flesh may do the same things as the person in Christ, but they do it for different reasons.

* Life in Christ – **Grace**:  Your worth is given as a gift. 

* Life in Christ – **Freedom**:  The freedom to love God as you are, love yourself as you are, and love others as they are.

* Life in Christ – **Fullness**:  Getting your worth from God, not because of who you are is the only way to get full.  Your soul can only be filled by His unconditional love.  
    * Living in the flesh is like eating a 7 course meal where all the food gets stuck in your teeth – it doesn’t fill you.


* Life in Christ – **Celebration**: Celebrating who you already are.  You can celebrate when you no longer need your environment to feed you.

* Life in Christ is *real* life 
    * Life in the flesh is dead.

The only way we can give unconditional love to the world around us is if we are getting unconditional love (for free!)

What determines whether you live in God’s love is whether you believe the lie that you are not full.  The truth is this: All you ever need is life in Jesus Christ – and if you are a Christian, you already have this life for free.

## Living out of our fullness

The problem: We believe the lie (from Genesis 3) that God can’t be counted on to make us full, so we believe the lie that we aren’t actually full, so we believe the lie that we can actually do stuff to get full, so we spend our lives chasing the fullness, and that is the very thing that prevents us from experiencing the fullness that we already have!  You don’t enjoy your life because you are trying to get life.

Just be.  Let God be who He is, and you just be who you are.

## When we make mistakes

There is a natural embarrassment when making a mistake that attaches to who you are.  Our culture believes that your doing is your being – instead of doing the wrong thing, you are the wrong thing.

When we discipline our children we need to make a clear distinction between what they did and who they are.  Who they are is full of unconditional love and worth.  Crack down on the behavior, but not who they are.  They then become motivated out of a fullness to want to change the behavior instead of out of shame.

## Confront the lies in your life

Expose the lies that try to define who you are – do this through prayer and invite Jesus into the place where those lies are and tell you the truth: that He loves you just as you are. 

## Summary

Just **be**.  Be who you are in Jesus.  Let go of the doing. God loves you unconditionally, which means He loves you no matter what you do.  Celebrate that fact and live in that fact!

 
God bless!
