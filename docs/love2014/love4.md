## Verse for the night

## Intro

We have been reviewing a lot about how important love is – and it is very familiar to many of us.  But that is the problem: We have known these verses for most of our lives, so when we hear it again, we don’t really hear it.  We know it, but we don’t really know it.  

As we study this – *pretend you don’t know anything about love.*

## The center of a christian 

What would be the first thing people think of when they think of Christians?

There would probably be some good things, probably a lot of negative things.  But how many people would immediately think of the word “love”?

If there is any one thing we are to impress upon the world, it is love – God’s love.

The central mark of the believer is to abide in God’s love, let God’s love abide in you, and overflow that love to others.  That is what it means to be a Christian!

How should we love others?  As Christ loved us.

Why should we love? [John 17:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17%3A21&version=NASB) – so that the world may know that God sent Jesus to love them.

The other things in the Christian life are great – but if love isn’t first place, they don’t even matter.

There is no bigger indictment on the church than when people have to be protected from the church.


## The place of love

Abiding in God – the center.  The place that should be our home.  We don’t live there all the time, but we need to remember that it is our home.

When you live in this place, you begin to see others as God sees them, you begin to ascribe worth to people as God does.  You begin to take on God’s heart when you live in this place.

This place is love.  All of the judgment and “pollution” that is in our mind goes away when we are in this place.  Even if you dislike someone – even if you think they are immoral – in this place, those thoughts come to an end because that is not your job description.  In this place, the only thing on your mind is the infinite worth of this person.  What you see is love, what you think about is love – because that is our only job description.

In this place is joy itself!  To abide in God is to take residence in God – and that is to take residence in love.  You see everyone through the eyes of Jesus, and you become free from yourself.

The goal of this study is to move our residence to this place.


## The only thing that matters

[Galatians 5:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A6&version=NIV):

> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.

The Galatians (like many Christians today) put too much worth on extra things, like circumcision.  God gave us grace – and through that grace, we are saved.  

The Galatians (and many Christians today) say “grace plus X equals what really matters."  Sure, we have grace, but we also need this or that to improve our standing with Christ.

In [Galatians 5:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A6&version=NIV), Paul is saying that all of those other things don’t matter.  “The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.”  When you take grace and add anything to it, it is no longer grace.

How can we try to increase our worth to God when it can’t be surpassed?

## Faith through love

Faith being manifested through love:  Faith that we believe who we are in Christ and faith to believe that the people around you have unsurpassable worth in Christ.  When we really believe this, we act on it.  Faith without works (actions) is dead.  This is why the only thing that matters is love.

The energy of faith is love.  The thing that makes faith work is love. Faith, by itself, if it has no works, is dead ([James 2:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A26&version=NASB)).  This is not saying we need to add works in order to have faith.  What it is saying that faith that isn’t dead, works.  It has energy to it.  The energy of faith is love.  When you ascribe unsurpassable worth to someone, you do something about it.

This is why love needs to be in first place.

## Balancing love with judgment

Some people think that you can’t just focus on love - People will never overcome their sins if you don’t hold them accountable for those sins.  There is a place to confront sin – when people have asked you to keep them accountable, or you are in strong, Christian relationship with them.  But judgment does not empower someone to overcome sin – it condemns them.  

Love is what gives someone power to overcome the sin in their life.


## Being blessed

Christians often pray to be blessed by God, which is a good thing - the intention is good.  But the best way you can get blessed, is to start blessing on others: You pray for blessings on others, you get blessed.  You help others, you get helped.  You give to others, you get.  When you stop looking for advantages for yourself, and start trying to give to others, it all comes back to you.


God bless!
