# Love #5
*3/19/2014*

<!--  -->


Here is the recap from the study we did a week and a half ago:

## Intro

We started out with a quick summary from our previous weeks, about how important God's love is (Letting God love us, loving ourselves, and God's love flowing out to others).

We then read [Genesis 3:1-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A1-7&version=NASB)

## Provision and Prohibition

We talked about how the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil were at the center of the garden ([Genesis 2:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A9&version=NASB)).  The importance of this is that in the paradise that God wants for us, there is a provision and a prohibition at the center.  The provision is the tree of life - God will meet our needs.  The prohibition is a boundary: leave to God what belongs to God (in this case, the knowledge of good and evil).

God's job is to judge good and evil - Our job is to reflect God's love to others.

## The center

When Eve at the fruit, she put her own will at the center of her life, and everything revolved around her.  The same goes with us after the fall: we are the center of our existence - we see the world through our own eyes.  

When we put ourselves at the center, we cut ourselves off from the source of our life, and we try to get that life from everything around us.  We live our lives out of hunger rather than fullness.  When we try to meet our own needs, we bring in our knowledge of good and evil, and evaluate things and people around us by judging them.  

Example: Do I like this kind of food, do I not like it.  Do I agree with that person, do I disagree with them.  Do I like that, do I dislike it?  *We evaluate everything around us.*

We have a perpetual commentary of judgement in our minds that we were never meant to have.  And all of these judgmental thoughts chokes off the one thing we were called to do: love.

God is able to love and judge at the same time - but we are not able to do this, which is why he prohibited it.

## Good judgement - Discernment

There is a time for routine judgement (analyzing things that could be dangerous), and there can even be a time to use our knowledge of good an evil to help Christian brothers.  If you are in an accountability relationship with someone who has invited you to let them know when they do things not consistent with God, that is a time where you can provide input.  But if the person has not invited you to do this, our job is to love them.

Any other judging that we do is simply a way of feeding ourselves - making you feel better about yourself.  You are drinking from a tree you were never made to drink of.

## What we know and don't know

One quote we heard a few times during our study was, "You need to know what you know, and know what you don't know". 

**Know what you know**:  we know that God is in control, so we need to trust Him on everything else.  We know God didn't intend for us to have the knowledge of good and evil, so leave that up to Him.

**Know what you don't know**:   You don't know the big picture, so let God handle it.  You don't know the situation of the person you want to judge, so don't judge them!  When we judge someone, you are acting like you have all of the information (which you don't - but God does).

## Excuses!

Another good point we talked about: We are very good at excusing our own behavior (the kids kept me up late, things are real stressful at work, etc), but we rarely try to explain other people's behavior - we usually just snap to a judgement about them.

## The cross of Jesus

We also heard the statement that our life could be governed by this mentality: learning to see God, see ourselves, and see others through the cross of Jesus (the love that He gave on the cross could not have been any more perfect).  

When this view gets blocked, we start to get our life by questioning others, questioning ourselves, and questioning God.  When that happens, we don't go to God to get life, and when we aren't receiving that life and love from God, we can't give it to others.

## Don't block the flow

All of the above illustrates how judgment starts to block out the flow of God's love in our lives, and certainly blocks us from letting God's love flow to others.  

**Note** - *I'm not saying that God's love stops flowing to us when we live in judgement - I'm just saying that we aren't getting our life from that love.  Just like the sun is always shining even though we might not always feel it*.

## A Challenge

1. Spend time getting rooted and grounded in God's love.  It takes time - set aside time to drink of God's love for you.  Let God love on you.
2. Try to practice being in the presence of God at all times.  Remember that in every moment, God's perfect love is being directed at you!  But also remember that His love is directed at the people around you.

**Abide in God's love!**
