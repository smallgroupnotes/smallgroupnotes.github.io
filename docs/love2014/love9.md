<!-- Let Love Lead -->

I mentioned on Sunday that we were covering the last of the sermons in the series.  Next time we meet we will have a question/answer time - I have some Q&A sessions from the sermon series we covered and we also thought it would be neat if we came up with some questions and try to answer them as a group.  We will send more info on that later.

 

The theme of the sermon that we listened to on Sunday was basically that love is a choice and is not tied to our emotions.

## A reminder
We started out with the reminder that everyone has infinite value to God.  God is love (I John 4:8) and he created us out of that love, in order to have a love relationship with us.  When we interact with people, we need to remember that God created *them* out of love too!

## A description of love
We also heard a really good description of love: Love is not doing what makes you feel good, it is doing what *is* good in spite of how you feel.

Love listens to your feelings but then involves a choice from your heart.

## Compelled by love
In 2 Corinthians 5:14-15, it says that Christ's love compels us.  This doesn't mean that God's love forces us to walk around loving everyone.  It means that God's amazing love should be the driving force behind our actions.

## An analogy
Then we heard an analogy that gave a good example of how love is a choice.  We compared our emotions to a thermometer where they go up and down with the environment around us.  Our emotions are not bad, and we should listen to our emotions to help us make good choices.  But we cannot command our emotions (we can command our choices) - Just like a thermometer cannot command the temperature to go up or down.

Love, and our choice to love, is like a thermostat.  A thermostat *chooses* to set the temperature.  It works with the furnace to raise the temperature in a room/building.  

This is like our choice to love: it is a choice to work with God to raise the "temperature" of love in our environment around us.  We need to make the choice to work with God to be counter-cultural by loving those around us, even if the world says they don't deserve it.

## Choosing to love
God calls us to love because God is love. This seems difficult, because how can a person feel love all the time? 

This is where choice comes in: We can choose love regardless of how we feel.  

We talked about how it is not about faking it.  We can truly be hurt by a person, and yet choose to respond in a way that is consistent with God's love.  We don't need to condone someone's behavior, but we are commanded to make the choice to love them anyways.  

(Like Jesus told the early Christians to love their enemies - at that period in time, the enemies of the Christians would burn them alive and many other cruel things).

## Summary
Doing everything in love is the greatest commandment that we receive from Jesus. It is also one of the most difficult. Commanding our choices is essential to loving others, and we shouldn't let our emotions decide our choices. 

Our emotions can play a part and give us information on a situation, but we should always reflect what our intellect and faith tell us to do as well. 

In this way, we can choose to clothe ourselves in love.

Have a blessed week!
