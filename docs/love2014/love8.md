# Love #8
*5/1/2014*

Here is the recap from our study on Sunday.  

## Brief Summary

> Smaller groups of community are vital for a believer to grow in Christ.  Since we live in a worldly culture, we need to be a part of a smaller sub-culture with role models and people who are committed to living counter-culturally with us.

> What does this have to do with love and judgment? 

> First: If a person has not invited you into their life to be committed to help them live a kingdom-focused life, your only opinion of them is that they were worth Jesus dying for. 

> Second: Discernment is a good type of judgment and is only to be exercised when you are in an agreed relationship with someone where you pledge to help each other live Godly lives.

 

That was my “brief” summary.  For more details, see the rest of this email.

## Summary of previous 7 weeks

You can have right beliefs, supernatural faith, great deeds, etc. – but if it is not motivated by Christ-like love, it is worthless ([1 Corinthians 13:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A1-3&version=NASB))

The main obstacle to Christ-like love is the original sin of the Bible: eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.  This knowledge brings about judgment and blocks us from being the people God wants us to be.  

Only God can judge perfectly and love perfectly – we can’t.

Judgment is about ascribing worth to ourselves at cost to others.  Love is about ascribing worth to others at cost to ourselves.

**We should only have one opinion of others**: *They were worth Jesus dying for.*

## A good kind of judgment

The word [Krino](http://biblehub.com/greek/2919.htm) in Greek means to separate or distinguish.  Bad judgment separates people, but good judgment usually separates things.

[Hebrews 5:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+5%3A14&version=NASB): 

> But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.

This kind of distinguishing or discernment is needed in the body of Christ – we can’t grow effectively in Christ without relationships with people who help us discern the good and bad things in our lives.

[1 Corinthians 5:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+5%3A12&version=NASB)

> What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?

In the church where people have committed to live like the bride of Christ, there needs to be discernment – relationships with other people that help us determine what is helping and what is hindering our walks with God.


## The context of the early church

The early church was made up of small groups of people that met on a very regular basis, usually in each others homes.

Today’s churches usually meet in a big building where many people aren’t in a deep relationship with each other.

It takes an agreement between people and a lot of investment to be committed to help each other discern.


## Judging a stranger

We may see behavior in a stranger (Christian or non-Christian) that we don’t agree with – but how do we know that is what God wants that person to be working on in their life?

In many of these cases you can do more harm than good by imposing your perceptions on the life of someone you know little about.

## We need discerning believers in our lives

We are social creatures, which means we will usually conform to the larger social environment that we are a part of.  That is why we need to be a part of a smaller sub-culture with role models and people who are committed to living counter-culturally with you.

We all have blind spots – it is very hard to accurately monitor yourself.

 If we are serious about living a distinct Kingdom life, we need to have input from other believers in our life.

## Individualism and Tolerance

The founding ideals of America are all about the individual – the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  This is almost opposite of the values of the Kingdom of God.

The kingdom of God begins when you die to your right of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

America is a great place to live – this isn’t saying America has it all wrong.  This is saying that the American values do not align with Kingdom values.

Part of living Kingdom lives is to be in strong relationships with others – where we need to die to tolerance and individualism (within the context of that relationship).


## Practical application

What relationships do you have where you can enter into a discerning relationship and choose to live counter-cultural, Kingdom-focused lives?

When it comes to strangers – you are allowed one opinion: God loves that person and died for them.

When it comes to people with whom you are committed to living a kingdom life, we need to help each other grow.  We still ascribe God’s love and worth to them, but the relationship needs to go beyond that to where you help each other grow and develop in God.

It also goes both ways: Not only do you need someone in your life to keep you Kingdom focused, but other believers around you might need your input in their lives so that they can grow!

 
## Thankful!

I mentioned this on Sunday, but I just want to re-iterate how thankful I am for this small group – this sermon we listened to just increased my passion for growing together in this group.  

I pray that we would grow deeper in our relationships with each other and God and become a group that “has each others' backs”, encourages each other, and impacts the world around us.

Have a great rest of the week!
