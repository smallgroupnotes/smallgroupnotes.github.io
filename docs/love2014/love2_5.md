# Love 2.5
*2/8/2014*

<!-- Intro Email -->

I just finished prepping the lesson that we will cover tomorrow.  It feels like the month of January was laying the foundation of learning to love yourself and know how much God truly loves you.  Tomorrow's lesson just blew me away - This is what the previous sermons have been leading up to!

## All
The keyword I am taking away from the lesson is: "All".  I bet you thought I was going to say Love! :)  

Today and tomorrow, think about the word "All" - think about what it means to you - get it in your head and I think it will change the way you hear tomorrow's lesson.  You can even read the definition and some synonyms for the word "All" if that helps.

I wanted to put the scripture references in this email so you can read them ahead of time.  I don't think we will have time to read them together tomorrow, but don't worry - he reads each one in the audio that we will be listening to, so we will definitely cover them.  

I put a few notes before each passage, and any emphasis in the verses was added by me.

## God's Love in us
[John 17:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17%3A26&version=NASB):

> and I have made Your(God) name known to them, and will make it known, so that the love with which You (God) loved Me (Jesus) may be *in* them, and **I in them**.

*(I added the words in the parenthesis)*

## The greatest commandment 
*Notice how Jesus replies with 2 commandments when asked what the greatest commandment is*

[Matthew 22:36-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A36-39&version=NASB):

> Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” And He said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with **all** your heart, and with **all** your soul, and with **all** your mind.’ This is the great and foremost commandment. The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’

## Love God AND love your brother
[1 John 4:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A21&version=NASB) 

> And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also.

## Which of our actions should be done in love? 
[1 Corinthians 16:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A21&version=NASB) 

> Let **all** that you do be done in love.

## How important is love?
[Colossians 3:14a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A14a&version=NASB)

> Beyond **all** these things put on love

## How often should we love? 
[1 Peter 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+4%3A8&version=NASB)

> **Above all**, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.

## The summary of the whole law
[Galatians 5:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A14&version=NASB)

> For the **whole** Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”

## Is it enough to think loving thoughts about someone, and not have to show them love?
[1 John 3:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A18&version=NASB)

> Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth.

## What happens if our actions are not done in love? 

[1 Corinthians 13:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A1-3&version=NASB)

> If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, *but do not have love, it profits me nothing*.

------------------------

You are probably starting to see why the word "All" stuck with me...

I'm really pumped about listening and discussing with you tomorrow.  This is life-changing!
