<!-- Knocking over the bear -->

In preparation for our next meeting there was an analogy in the sermon that we are covering that I won't include in our audio for the sake of time. I thought it was an awesome analogy and had to share it with you - this is my paraphrase from memory, so hopefully I do it justice:

Let's make up a new carnival game, where the object of the game is to throw a ball and knock over fuzzy little stuffed animals (that are, of course, ridiculously hard to knock over).  In the center of all the fuzzy animals is a fuzzy bear - the only bear out of all the other stuffed animals.

Here is the rule: The only way to win a prize in this game is to knock over the bear.  In fact, if you are able to knock over the bear, you get **all** of the prizes in the booth!  If you knock over any of the other animals, it doesn't count for anything - you don't win any prizes.

So here is the (obvious) question: If you were playing this carnival game, which animal would you spend all of your time trying to knock over?  What would you spend all of your time on - what would your focus be?

I'm sure you already see the analogy with what we discussed about love.  If the Bible says, "Above all, above everything else, love", what should we focus on?  We can spend our time trying to knock over the other "animals" of donating stuff to the poor, giving generously, etc, but if we don't do it in love, it wasn't worth it.  Sure, it looks impressive if I'm zoned in and can knock over animal after animal in that game - Wow!  Nice shot!  Great aim!  You really know how to knock those animals over!  But if I didn't knock over the bear - big deal, right? 

Just like [1 Corinthians 13:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A1-3&version=NIV) says - I can fathom all mysteries and knowledge, give **all** of my possessions to the poor, have faith to move mountains - Wow!  Nice Job!  You really are a model Christian - just look what you can do!  But then the passage finishes with: But if I do not have love, I gain nothing, I am nothing, I am a clanging cymbal - it's just religious noise.

Those other things are important and good, yes - but first, we need to work on love: living love, being clothed in love, doing everything in love.  Once we do everything in love - imagine the effectiveness of our actions - imagine the glory that goes to God!

Have a great weekend - I can't wait to meet on Sunday!
