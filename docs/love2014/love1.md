# Love #1

<!-- Knowing your name -->

Here is the recap from last Sunday on "Knowing your name".

The general theme of what we discussed had to do with letting yourself be loved by God - how can we fully love God and others, if we are not fully feeling the love from God?

## God-shaped hole
The quote we heard at the beginning was: "Everything we need we've already got - we are full in Christ Jesus.  The only problem is that we *think* we have a problem - so we spend all of our time trying to get what He has already given us for free.  The very act of us trying to get it prevents us from experiencing it for free."  This has to do with the "God shaped hole" we have in our lives.  Basically - the time we spend trying to fill the "God shaped holes" in our lives are keeping us from experiencing a full relationship with Him - which is the only thing that can fill the holes in our lives.

Hearing these words are not enough, though - we need an actual transformation in our lives - and a major way we can experience this transformation is by leaving behind the old names we have been called and embracing the new names God has given us.

## Significance of names

We discussed the passage in [Daniel 1:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+1%3A6-7&version=NASB) where the king changed the names of the Hebrew captives.  In those days, their names were more than a label - there names were phrases that had significant meaning.  The king changed their names because he knew how powerful a name is to a person, and how he could use their names to bend them.

Here are the names of the 4 Hebrews and what they were changed to:

> Daniel - God is my Judge <br />
> Balshazar - Guarded by Ba'al

> Hananiah - The Lord is gracious<br />
> Shadrach - Under Aku's command

> Mishael - Who is like God<br />
> Meshach - Who is like Sheshach

> Azariah - The Lord is my helper<br />
> Abednego - Slave of Nebo

We talked about how amazing it would be if your name actually was "The Lord is my helper" - if every time someone talked to you, they called you that.  If you heard that over and over, every day of your life.  That would have to impact you.  I'm sure some days, you glaze over it because you heard it so much, but overall, it would have a positive impact on you.

The opposite is true - if you had a bad name, that would be such a negative impact.

We also heard that generally, the person who names someone usually has some authority over the person they are naming.

The summary of this is that names are very powerful, and can be a blessing or a curse in someone's life.

## Our names

In our society, our names are more labels or social cues.  Some of us know what the meaning of our name is, but it is usually not something we dwell on very often.  However, as we have grown up, we usually give names to ourselves, or others have given us names whether they intended to or not.

Some examples of good names people can receive: "You are a blessing to us", "You are loved by God", "You are an amazing person", etc.
Some example of bad names people get are: "You are ugly", "You are stupid", "You can't do anything right", "No one likes you", etc.

We can easily see that if you heard these names (good or bad) over and over, they would definitely impact your life.

## A new name

The focal point in our discussion was how when we became Christians, God gave us a new name, and we don't have to listen to the our old, bad names any more.  It takes time to learn to respond to a new name.  It takes even more time to stop responding to old ones that are lies about who you are.  But remember that Christ is the Truth, and you are in Christ, therefore in the Truth.  We need to let our "I am" names be defined by the Great "I AM"!

We also heard that Daniel and his friends probably didn't always live up to their awesome names - but that doesn't mean their names were not valid.  When you mess up, dust yourself off and remember that the sin does not define you - remember who you really are in Jesus.

## Summary
The 3 points we heard in summary were:

1. Start noticing your the names you have been called, especially when you make choices that don't align with God's will.  Don't notice these names to get down on yourself - just to realize that there is a name you have been answering to.

2. Stop the influence of the bad names, by remembering your true names in Christ.

3. Use the old names to serve as a reminder of your new name.  For example, when you hear your old name "You are stupid, you can't do anything right" - use that to remember the name God gave you: "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me!"

*Try to make your names in Christ a part of your subconscious - dwell on these names, and let the truth sink in.*

## A Challenge

As a wrap up, I challenged all of us to search the Bible for names that God has given you, and share them with the group.

Here are the names that I have been finding (I use the NAS translation in case these verses didn't translate the same in other translations):

> I am a delight to God - Zephaniah 3:17

> God rejoices over *me* with shouts of joy! - Zephaniah 3:17

> I am loved by God - John 3:16

> I am valuable to God - Matthew 10:30-31

> God is for me - Romans 8:31

> I am God's friend - John 15:14

> I am forgiven - Acts 10:43, Colossians 1:14

> I am whiter than snow - Psalm 51:7

> God pours His love over me - Romans 5:5

> I am God's handiwork - Ephesians 2:10

> God fellowships with me - 1 Corinthians 1:9

> God's love for me is boundless - Ephesians 3:17-19

> I am clothed with Christ - Galatians 3:27

> God gives me strength - Isaiah 40:29

> God covers me with His hand - Exodus 33:22
