# Mercy and Purity of Heart

## What is mercy?

Empathizing in order to have compassion. 

**Empathy:**

> Em - into

> Pathos - to suffer. 

> Enter into another's suffering 

**Compassion:**

> Com - alongside of

> Pathos - to suffer

> Suffer alongside or in conjunction with

Mercy - enter into the suffering of another and sacrifice of your own resources to meet their needs. 

Mercy can also come around people with physical ailments but mercy usually deals with people who need forgiveness. 

God does the same for us: instead of giving us the judgment we deserve he gives us the forgiveness we don't deserve. 

When we surrender to God, we are given the character of mercy.   The same mercy He showed to us is now in us - it becomes our identity - a part of our "DNA". 

## The opposite of mercy

We can't show mercy until we are willing to allow the pain of others into our life. 

Two things block the flow of mercy: Apathy and Judgment. 

Apathy: my own life is hard enough so I can't deal with others. 

We need to be willing to imagine what life is like in another person's shoes and collapse our judgment. 

Judgment in Greek means to separate. 

Mercy means moving towards a person and trying to get inside. Judgment separates you from a person and tries to put you above them. 

You can't empathize with someone while also separating from them. 

Love: ascribing worth to another at cost to yourself. 

Judgment: ascribing worth to yourself at cost to others. 

If we are going to be people of mercy, we need to stop judging. 

The only thing we can ever know for sure about someone is that they were worth Jesus dying for. 

Pray for your enemies. God will show you the world through their perspective. 

## Pure in Heart

Kierkegaard said: Purity of heart is to will one thing. 

Purity of Heart: a singular focus - not being pulled in multiple directions. 

Having a pure heart means you still do the things you usually do but you bring a kingdom heart and mindset into it. 

Seek *first* the Kingdom of God.   

Integrate God into everything and everything into God. 

If you have a pure heart you will see God.

## The Reward 

Is seeing God a "prize" for having a pure heart?
Is having mercy shown towards you a "prize" for showing mercy?

That would mean that mercy is earned - which wouldn't be mercy.

The blessings of the beatitudes are natural consequences not rewards that are handed out.

[1 John 3:2-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A2-3&version=NIV)

> Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure. 

The more you are like God - the more you will see God. The more you see God the more motivated you are to be like God - the cycle snowballs. 

Seeing God is not a prize but a natural consequence of living a life of cultivating a character that can see God. 

Mercy is not a prize for being merciful. If you are engaged in a behavior that softens your heart, the more you will know and experience God's mercy. 

The more we act like God we will be like Him and see Him as He is. 

## Challenges

1. Revisit: Pray for your enemy (or someone you really don't like). Ask God to show you the world through their perspective. 

2. [Psalm 46:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+46%3A10&version=NIV) "Be still and know that I am God."  Take some time to be still with God and listen to Him to hear what it means to seek first His Kingdom.  What does it look like to have a single focus on Him? Think about the things we fill our time with and the things we put in our minds.
