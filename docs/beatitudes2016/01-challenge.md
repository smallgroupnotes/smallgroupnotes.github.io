Hi everyone,

The biggest take-aways I took from our study on Sunday were:

1. You are blessed when the only thing you need is God (although when that happens outside of your own choosing, it doesn't feel like a blessing in the moment).
2. In the midst of pain, grief, and mourning, the blessing of God's comfort is knowing that God is good.  It doesn't mean the circumstance are better, but it is comforting to know that God is in control.

A side note I thought about when thinking about point #2 was persecuted Christians.  Usually when I hear stories of Christians who are being persecuted (and even put to death) the Christians are calm and many times singing.  It always baffled me, until now...  How do so many persecuted Christians face their persecution so calmly, and I often doubt that I would react the same way.  After the study last night, I believe they are demonstrating the ultimate example of God's comfort.  Their circumstances are definitely not improving - but they are taking comfort in the fact that God is good, and that he will work their bad situation out for good.

I'm not sure if that is clear or not, but the idea of God's comfort in our times of mourning became very clear to me as we studied that passage.

Okay - I got sidetracked :)  My point was to follow up on our challenge from last night - so here it is:

**Challenge #1** - "The Give Up Everything Prayer Challenge".  Go around your house in prayer, and "donate" everything to God.  (And remember, like we mentioned last night - it already is God's!)  As an added bonus, as you donate your possessions to God, ask Him to show you how you can use *His* possessions to impact His Kingdom.

**Challenge #2** - the one-percent challenge.  Prayerfully consider what it would look like to give 1% more this year than you are already giving.  

These challenges relate to my point #1 towards the top of the email.  If we are blessed when we need less of our own stuff and completely rely on God, then it is a good exercise to prayerfully consider giving (back) more.

It's not really my business to know if or how much the families in this group are giving - but I think it is the business of each member of our group to encourage each other to be salt and light to the world around us - to make a Kingdom difference.

I'll close with one more point from last night's meeting that has been really sticking with me:  The woman who owns "The Blessing House".  She gave everything she has to God to build and take care of large house that is used to bless anyone who can make use of it.  She doesn't have any possessions - and she is blessed.  She doesn't worry about theft or anything like that, because the entire house belongs to God and she is just taking care of it.  That must be such a freeing feeling!

Anyways, thank you all for the great discussion last night.  Pray about the challenges, and let's try to encourage each other to be salt and light: to be in contact with the world but to be different from the world.
