# The Salt and Light Revolution

*01/10/2016*

## Intro

If we manifest the qualities of the beatitudes, Jesus says we will be salt and light to the world.  The beatitudes also say that if we manifest these qualities, we will be blessed.

These blessings are the opposite of what the world would call blessed, which is why God's kingdom is revolutionary.

## Background

The opinion was given that the beatitudes were targeted at the disciples, not the crowd of people that were following them.

The beatitudes are not laws and commands, but they are descriptors of what a disciple should look like.

Jesus wasn't saying "Try to mourn, try to be persecuted", etc.  He was saying, "If you follow me, you *will* mourn, you *will* be persecuted", etc. - but you will be blessed.

## What does salt preserve?

Being salt isn't meant to say that we are to preserve and fight for traditional values.

Our job is to advance the kingdom of God not to try to run the kingdom of the world.

So if our job isn't to preserve traditional values in the world around us, what should we preserve?

In the Old Testament, salt was a sign of God's covenant to His people, so our job is to preserve the covenant for the world.

Our presence in this world should be a constant reminder to people of how God loves them and wants to invite them into His kingdom.

We are salt by manifesting what it looks like to be in a covenant relationship with God.

## Being separate from the world

In order for salt to season and preserve food, it has to be distinct from that food but also has to remain in contact with that food.

We can't be a reminder of God's covenant love and a seasoning influence in people's lives if we are no different from them.

"Be in the world, but not *of* the world"

## Light in the darkness

The purpose of being a disciple of Jesus is to serve the world by manifesting the covenant that God made with the world.

As light, we should contrast the world with the kingdom of God.

## Our purpose and identity

When we surrender our life to God, **it is not just for us** - our *purpose* is to serve the world and to be used by His kingdom.

If you aren't serving others, you end up judging others.  Or conversely - it will be hard to judge others if you are serving them.

Jesus doesn't say you carry the light or you carry the salt - He says you *are* the light and you *are* the salt - it is our *identity*.

In the Old Testament, God set Israel apart so that they could be an example of what it is like to live in a covenant with God - but instead they isolated themselves, got arrogant and looked down on the ones they were supposed to serve.  The same thing happens with a lot of churches/christians.  We aren't a light on a hill to look down on the world around us but to be a beacon of light to the world.

## Are we doing our job?

Do our lives differ from the surrounding culture?

Are we being salt and light to the people we are with in this world?

Are we finding opportunities to "mix it up" with the world and invite them into the Kingdom.

## Becoming a disciple

A disciple doesn't ask, "How can I use Jesus to my benefit?"  A disciple begins to be a disciple when they ask, "How can I be used by Jesus for His benefit?"

The kingdom isn't about crowds - the kingdom is about disciples, who make disciples.

> My prayer for our small group: that people would look at us and say, "Wow - there's a group of people who display the beatitudes"

## The Challenge

> Note: There will be a new challenge for our group every week!  Pray that God would open your heart to seriously thinking about these challenges!

How can we learn to be used by Jesus?

What needs to change in our life to be the salt that we are called to be?

Are we willing to commit to living a life that will *significantly* contrast with the surrounding culture?

Will we seek God's wisdom on how we can arrange our life differently?

> * So we have more time available to fellowship (grow with believers, but also do life with non-believers)
> * So we spend less money on ourselves and have more to share

### We are the kingdom to the degree that we bleed/sacrifice.
