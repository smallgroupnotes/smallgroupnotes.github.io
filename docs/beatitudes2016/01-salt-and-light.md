# The Salt and Light Revolution

## Intro

If we manifest the qualities of the beatitudes, Jesus says we will be salt and light to the world.

## Background

The beatitudes are not laws and commands, but they are descriptors of what a disciple should look like.

## What does salt preserve?

Our job is to advance the kingdom of God not to try to run the kingdom of the world.

We preserve the covenant for the world.

## Being separate from the world

In order for salt to season and preserve food, it has to be distinct from that food but also has to remain in contact with that food.

## Light in the darkness

The purpose of being a disciple of Jesus is to serve the world by manifesting the covenant that God made with the world.

## Our purpose and identity

When we surrender our life to God, it is not just for us - our purpose is to serve the world and to be used by His kingdom.

If you aren't serving others, you end up judging others.

Jesus doesn't say you carry the light or you carry the salt - He says you *are* the light and you *are* the salt - it is our *identity*

## Are we doing our job?

Do our lives differ from the surrounding culture?

Are we being salt and light to the people we are with in this world?

## Becoming a disciple

A disciple doesn't ask, "How can I use Jesus to my benefit?"  A disciple begins to be a disciple when they ask, "How can I be used by Jesus for His benefit?"

The kingdom isn't about crowds - the kingdom is about disciples.

> My prayer for our small group: that people would look at us and say, "Wow - there's a group of people who display the beatitudes"

## The Challenge

> Note: There will be a new challenge for our group every week!  Pray that God would open your heart to seriously thinking about these challenges!

How can we learn to be used by Jesus?

What needs to change in our life to be the salt that we are called to be?

Are we willing to commit to living a life that will *significantly* contrast with the surrounding culture?

Will we seek God's wisdom on how we can arrange our life differently?

> * So we have more time available to fellowship
> * So we spend less money on ourselves and have more to share

### We are the kingdom to the degree that we bleed
