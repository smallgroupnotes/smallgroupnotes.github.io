# Blessed are the Meek

*3/6/2016*

# Matthew 5:5

## Meaning of the words "Meek" and "Inheritance"

The word meek is related to the word power, but the power is submitted.

A good example of this is a (powerful) horse that has submitted its power to its master.

Are you willing to detach from your pursuit of power and control?

Those who are meek will receive the earth as an inheritance from your Father.

An inheritance comes to us at the proper time - not right away.

## Inheriting the earth

Most wars have been waged over land and expansion, but Jesus said that meek will inherit the land.

The meek will expand the kingdom and do spiritual warfare against the enemy.

**People are never the enemy - people are victims of the enemy.**

An inheritance is something given - not taken.

## Meekness versus Anger

We need to hunger and thirst for a righteousness that begins with us.

Meekness - also translated as gentle.  

Meekness is not weakness, but power under control.

If Jesus calls us all to meekness it means that even the "alpha" types can learn the way of gentleness.

A contrast to meekness is anger.

Jesus mentioned anger and murder in the same sentence in Matthew 5:21-22.

A common theme regarding anger in the Bible: Be gentle, don't be angry.

Godʼs anger is righteous, because he is the Judge. John 3:36; Romans 1:18; 2:5; Ephesians 5:6; Colossians 3:6

Our anger is unrighteous, because we are not the Judge. Matthew 5:22; Ephesians 4:31; Colossians 3:8; 1 Timothy 2:8

## Contrast the world's power versus Jesus

Society suggests that powerful people are able to take what they need.

As we look at this third beatitude, we see Jesus working His way closer and closer to our core:

> 1. You are blessed when you aren't attached to your possessions.
> 2. You are blessed when you aren't attached to pleasure and comfort.
> 3. You are blessed when you aren't attached to power and being in control. 

## Challenging questions on being meek

1. Have I given my fears and need to be in control to God? Mark 4:40
2. Do I trust he will give me what I need in his time? Matthew 6:25-34
3. Do I have ways to remind myself to embrace my weakness and humility? John 13:14
4. Do I want to live as a servant of God and others? Matthew 20:25-28

**Control** - Fear usually drives the need to be in control.  Fear that your life will go bad if you aren't in control causes you to grasp for control.

**Trust** - Are you putting too much (all?) trust in yourself?

**Humility** - Jesus washed the feet of his disciples.  Are you willing to be humble and do something similar?

**Serve**  - Are you serving yourself, or are you serving God (and as a result, others)?

## The Unconditional Surrender challenge
Take out a piece of paper and write down everything you want (or should) surrender to God.  Pray over the list, and then sign it over to God.

**God wants us to unconditionally surrender our fears and our need for control and embrace the inheritance He wants to give us that is secure forever.**

## Five points about meekness and anger

1. Be slow to get angry – it isnʼt helping the way you think it is. James 1:19-20
2. Be quick to get rid of anger – it is harming more than you realize. Ephesians 4:26-27
3. Let love, not anger, be your motivation for action. Ephesians 5:2; Matthew 7:1-5; John 3:16
4. Transmute unrighteous anger into godly sorrow, grief, mourning. Romans 12:15; 1 Corinthians 12:26; 2 Corinthians 6:11
5. Be filled with the Spirit, and thereby his fruit. Ephesians 5:18; Galatians 5:22-23

Human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires. James 1:19-20 (**WOW!!**)

Sometimes people use anger as a motivation to do good things, but you can do those good things without the anger.

Ephesians 4:26-27
> “In your anger do not sin”: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and **do not give the devil a foothold.**

Maybe the initial feeling of anger is the temptation to sin, but after the initial feeling we need to be careful to not let that anger take hold of us.

*Are you hungry and thirsty for righteousness?*
