# Poor in Spirit and those who mourn

*2/14/2016*

# Matthew 5:3-4

## Intro

Poor in spirit: Someone depleted, broken, empty (rich or poor).

Those who mourn: Refers to mourning of the Jews in exile.  Grieving 

You are blessed when you have lost what you *feel* is most dear to you - only then can you be embraced by the one who **is** most dear to you.

When you are poor in Spirit you can no longer rely on your own resources, ingenuity or independence.

When you have lost the resources you use to empower you and figure things out on your own - Jesus says you are blessed.

## Poor in Spirit versus rich in the flesh

Humans were created to be completely dependent on God - we were *created* to get all of our core worth, identity, and life from God alone.

His design was that He is supposed to pour Himself into us, and as we get full of Him, we overflow towards others.  But in order to get full of Him, we need to trust Him and be totally dependent on Him.

Our fallen state: we have a vacuum inside us, but instead of going to God to get filled, we try to fill ourselves with people and things - these things become idols to us.

An idol is anything that fills the role in our life that only God can play - this is living in the flesh.

In the flesh, life becomes a feeding frenzy (from wealth, attention, good looks, reputation) to try to fill ourselves - to try to get the life that God wants to give us for free.

Because this vacuum will never go away (unless God fills it), we become addicted to trying to fill it ourselves.

Jesus exposes the demonic deception we are under when we think we can fill ourselves - He tells us we are blessed when we are at the end of our rope and we have lost what is most dear to us, because now we can finally get filled with God.

Blessed are you when you are empty, because now you can get filled with God.

Blessed are you when you don't have stuff to cling to, because now you can cling to God.

God created us to have all of our needs met by Him.

This is why Jesus says that it is harder for rich people to enter the kingdom of God - if you are a winner at the world's idolatry game, you can keep feeding yourself.  The more you can feed yourself the more you dull the ache in your soul that hungers for God.

The best thing that can happen to us is for us to lose and come to the end of ourselves - because now we can feel our need for God and be comforted by God.

## Can we still have wealth?

Are we blessed because we have so much stuff?

Having a lot of resources *can* be a blessing if you submit them to God.

It takes a lot of character to have wealth but not feed off of it and genuinely rely completely on God.

To come into the kingdom means we give everything over to the King, and become dependent on our King once again.

[Luke 14:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+14%3A33&version=NIV)

> In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.

Jesus told the rich young ruler ([Mark 10:17-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A17-27&version=NASB)) that he needed to *literally* give away all of his possessions.  Jesus knew he was seriously addicted to his possessions and couldn't rely fully on God while he kept them.

Jesus allows us to *legally* own some things but we need to understand that it really isn't ours.

What Jesus tells us we can enjoy (of His possessions) feel free to enjoy and not feel guilty about it.  But if He says to give it away or share it we need to do that - because it isn't ours!

To the degree we hold onto our things as though they were ours, we need to go through the mourning process of giving them up.
 
## Blessed when we mourn

There are times in history when following Jesus meant you were rejected by your loved ones, treated like an alien, or even put into prison, tortured and executed - that is a kind of mourning and suffering as well.

Even today, if you get radical about following Jesus, there will be times when family members or close friends get mad, worried, or uncomfortable with you.

All of this sounds like a curse to our culture but Jesus calls it blessed.

Our culture teaches us to avoid pain and to live life as comfortable as possible.

We are blessed when we mourn our "loss" - because when we lose everything we can gain everything.

True blessing is when you need only one thing - the love of God.

Life can be lived passionately when you are no longer clinging to stuff.

If we live this way, we are the sign of the covenant and we become salt and light to the world.

## The challenge

Question: Are you really at the end of your rope?  Do you rely on yourself or do you rely on God?

If you genuinely rely on God it should happen now and then that you will be in trouble if God doesn't show up.  

If we are following Him, he will occasionally ask us to do something that doesn't follow common sense.

If the answer to the question is "no", reorient your life around Jesus and follow Him!

Challenge: 

In prayer, envision your life owned by God.  

Then pray about all of the things you own and envision them as property of Jesus. 

Then pray about things that are important to you (reputation, good looks, etc) and give them to God.

Then pray about the loved ones in your life and give them to God.

We can enjoy these things, but we cannot own them.

### We do life best (in a kingdom way) when we cling to nothing

We dance through life with open palms, enjoying what He allows us to enjoy - being free with everything else.
