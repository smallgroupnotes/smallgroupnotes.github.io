# Peacemakers and the Persecuted

## Intro

Being a peacemaker does not mean avoiding conflict.

Being a peacemaker isn't just about being skilled at resolving arguments (although that can help as well).

*Being* a peacemaker - it is not just something we do (verb) - being a peacemaker is what we are (noun).

## Mataiotēs

Why is there conflict in the first place?

God created the world as a place to reflect his glory and shalom (wholeness, harmony, integration).

When some of the angels rebelled and when humans sinned, the authority that God gave them (us) which was intended for good now became a force that worked against God's creation.

[Romans 8:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROMANS+8%3A20&version=NASB):
> For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope

Futility-> Mataiotēs (depravity, frailty, void of appropriateness).  The world doesn't operate appropriately - it is in mataiotēs.

God didn't leave us in the mataiotēs world - he became human in order to free us.

[1 John 3:8b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+3%3A8&version=NASB)
> The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil.

Jesus came to bring harmony and reconciliation - to end the mataiotēs.

[Colossians 1:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=COLOSSIANS+1%3A19-20&version=NASB)
> For it was the Father’s good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him, and through Him to ***reconcile*** all things to Himself, having made ***peace*** through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven.

## Manifesting Peace in this world

Jesus' expression of perfect love on the cross broke the power of mataiotēs, restored humans to their rightful place, and has brought peace to all things.

This has happened in principle (Jesus defeated sin and mataiotēs) but it has not yet manifested completely.

We live in an interval between the fact and the manifestation of the fact.

Since God lives forever, there is virtually no time in this interval - but for humans who live so short, our perspective is that this interval is very long.

We are to be people who put on display what is already true in principle.  Our true identity participates in harmony and shalom.

When we reflect the harmony and character of Abba Father, we are called the Children of God.

## Our true identity

Why is there conflict in human relationships?

All conflict is a result of having some aspect of our identity anchored in the mataiotēs world.  (Struggle to get, struggle to keep, struggle to protect).

We participate in the mataiotēs world when our identity is in the mataiotēs world.

Being a follower of Jesus means you die to the world of mataiotēs.  Your identity to should be 100% rooted in Jesus and Him crucified.

Know that you are a child of God and have His Spirit living inside you - and now you are free from the world of mataiotēs.

Once your identity is anchored in God and not in the world, you can be a peacemaker.

## Our call to be peacemakers

When you are rightly-related to God you have a shalom that you can put on display for the world to experience.

[Galations 2:20a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galations+2%3A20&version=NASB)
> I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.

Being a peacemaker is who we are - by not getting sucked into the endless cycle of hostility.

When you stay centered as a peacemaker, you have wisdom on how to respond in ways that will ***further*** peace!

In order to ***be*** peacemakers, we need to die to the mataiotēs world *daily* and become free instead of *contributing* to the mataiotēs world.

## Persecuted

If you are following Jesus you will look different and you will stand out - which will be perceived as a threat.

Be blessed - when you people think you are odd and go against you - know that "yours is the kingdom of heaven."

Remember your identity is in Christ and respond with love.

When you are being persecuted, you are doing something right.

*Your life should either attract people to the kingdom (because they want something different) or it will repel them (because they think you are a threat)* - persecution is a sign that you are following Jesus.
