# Hunger and Thirst for Righteousness

*3/6/2016*

# Matthew 5:6



## How to be hungry and thirsty

A summary of the study of the first 3 beatitudes:
> 1. You are blessed when you aren't attached to your possessions.
> 2. You are blessed when you aren't attached to pleasure and comfort.
> 3. You are blessed when you aren't attached to power and being in control. 

When Satan tempted Jesus, he tempted Him with possessions, pleasure/comfort, and power.  This shows that Jesus Himself also had to give up these things.

After He was tempted, He was hungry and thirsty.

When we empty ourselves of our possessions, comforts, and quest for power we become hungry and thirsty.  What are you hungry and thirsty for?

## What is righteousness?

Micah 6:8
> ... And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.

Justice: Everyone is treated equally.  People aren't built up at the expense of other people.

Mercy: God's right way of living - the stronger serve the weaker.  Seeking out ways to show compassion.

Humility: Easily led.  Having a modest opinion of one's own importance.

Is this the dream you have for your life?  Is it your passion to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly?  Is that what you hunger and thirst for?

## Challenging questions

1. Do I truly hunger and thirst for God’s right way to live? Matthew 6:33
2. Do I long for his justice, mercy and humility in my life? Micah 6:8,Matthew 6:3
3. Do I regularly create space in my life to feel that hunger for God and his way of living? Matthew 6:16-18; Luke 5:35; Acts 13:1-3
4. Do I want God’s life for me?  Matthew 6:33

## The hunger challenge

Take a day to fast from food, technology, comfort, distractions.  In the afternoon, in that place of hunger, meet with God and ask Him if you are truly seeking His right way of living.

## What are you hungry for?

If you are going to a Thanksgiving feast, do you fill yourself with junk food in the day before, or do you intentionally make yourself hungry for the good food you know you are going to eat?

When we make ourselves spiritually hungry, Jesus says that we will be filled.
