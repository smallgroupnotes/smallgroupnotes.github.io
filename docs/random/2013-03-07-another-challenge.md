# Another Challenge
*3/7/2013*

## Intro
I hope you are all doing well!  A couple of weeks ago I put up a challenge to pray for someone you think doesn't know Jesus.

I'd like to give another challenge - this one is a bit harder, but I've been doing it for a little while, and it is crazy how God uses it in your life.

## The challenge
Here it is:  Pray for an enemy.  Maybe it's someone you work with that you can't stand, someone who rubs you the wrong way, someone who has hurt you, etc.  If you don't have an enemy, pray for a national enemy.  Maybe it's not even an enemy per se, but just someone you really don't like.

Pray for that person every day - it doesn't even have to be a long prayer.  Don't pray prayers that are trying to change them because that means you are still dwelling on how you don't like them.  Simply: pray for blessings upon them.  Pray that God would work in their life and their family's life.

## My person
I knew right away who I was going to pray for, and at first, it stunk.  But slowly, you start to view that person as another child of God, who has inexpressible worth and is deeply loved by God. 

Eventually, you start to change.  Instead of thinking negative thoughts about that person, you are spending that time blessing them, and your heart has a change for the better as well.

It's all about God's love, and how we can share God's love with others.

Have a great rest of the week!
