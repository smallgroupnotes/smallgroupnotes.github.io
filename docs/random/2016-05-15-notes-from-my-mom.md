# Notes from my mom

* Only one thing matters - Jesus and knowing Him.

* Jeremiah  9:23-24 (NLT):
> This is what the Lord says:
> “Don’t let the wise boast in their wisdom,
>     or the powerful boast in their power,
>     or the rich boast in their riches.
> But those who wish to boast
>     should boast in this alone:
> **that they truly know me and understand that I am the Lord**
>     who demonstrates unfailing love
>     and who brings justice and righteousness to the earth,
> and that I delight in these things.
>     I, the Lord, have spoken!

## Commitment

* Commitment to Abide: Get your source from the Vine and just be the branch:
> “Rest harder not work harder”  - Jefferson Bethke 

* Challenge to not eat food for the day until she had eaten food for her soul

* Make relationship with God intentional like a marriage (don't just spend a few minutes a day and an hour on Sundays)

* Make God the ultimate goal - and only God.

* Make God the treasure - become the treasure hunter

* Make God the first in your life:
> “Put first things first and we get second things thrown in: put second things first and we lose both first and second things.” - C.S. Lewis

## Motivation

* Love God for who He is - His essence, not his benefits

* See yourself as the child of God: "You don't try to *be* someone's child, you just *are*"

* Seek him as your treasure: Matthew 13:44-46

* Psalm 27:4 - "The one thing I ask of the Lord — the thing I seek most — is to live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, delighting in the Lord’s perfections and meditating in his Temple."

* Rest: Don't try to *do* the beatitudes - *be* the beatitudes

## John 17:20
> I am praying not only for these disciples but also for all who will ever believe in me through their message.

Jesus prayed for ***you***!

## A quote from my mom:

> The only thing that made a difference for me was spending time sitting with God and His Word.  It started out as gaining information. Just reading and realizing how little I knew.  Each day I would spend more and more time, reading and listening.  Being convicted and confessing my sin.  I regret wasting so much of my life not “knowing” God.  There is so little time left and so much of God’s love to give away.  How can you know someone if the only spend five minutes a day and an hour on Sundays?

> As I read and spent time with the Lord a natural desire to dig deeper rose up in me.  Studying words or reading for long periods of time.  I just was so thirsty for Him.  My love and delight in Him grew and still grows.  Each day is an adventure or a struggle depending on what God is working out in my life.  

## List of important things to help in becoming a "treasure hunter"

1.  READ the Bible EVERY Day (We are prone to wander and need food daily)
2.  Read books that help you understand the Bible
3.  Read books that challenge you
4.  Read with other believers
5.  Pay attention to how you hear the Word. Luke chapter 8 is a great chapter! Parable of the Farmer and Scatter of the seed, parable of the lamp.  Verse 18:  “So pay attention to how you hear. To those who listen to my teaching more understanding will be given.”
6.  Stand on His promises.  How can you know His promises if you don’t READ.  Psalm 91:4b “His faithful promises are your armor and protection.”  Susie Larson says “…may your sturdy grasp of God’s promises intimidate the enemy…”  Need to know those promises to fight the enemy.   (He will Never leave you, He will hold you close Ps. 27, He is our home Ps. 90, He is with us, He will never fail us, He will never lie, He tells the truth always….)
7.  Be a Berean, Test everything against Scripture
8.  Study words and themes as God reveals them.  “Confident” or “Listen” 
9.  Visualize - Put yourself in the scene.  (John 13-17) Especially John 17:20
10. Search for yourself.  Sermons and books are great, but finding a Truth that God has given you is great growth in your love relationship with Him.  Find that nugget of Truth, own it, grow in it and then give it away!
11. Don’t wait to Abide in Him.  Sell everything you have if you have to.  Get up at 2:00 am if you have to.  He is so worth it and you will never regret it.
