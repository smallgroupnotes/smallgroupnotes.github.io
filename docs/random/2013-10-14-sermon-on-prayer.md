# Sermon on Prayer
*10/14/2013*

I thought it was really cool that the sermon in church yesterday was on Prayer.
He said a few things that really meshed with what we have been discussing
in our group.

One thing he said that stood out to me was when he was talking about God's
power:  He said so many times, people get focused on our prayers being
powerful, but in reality, our prayers draw on God's power to accomplish
much. I know it's just kind of a wording difference, but I think it helps
to keep the focus on God, and not let ourselves get in the way.

It lines up with the analogy we talked about a while ago about God setting
aside a "resivoir" of power for us to access when we come to Him in prayer.

I just thought it was neat to hear another version of what we have been
learning!
