# Small Group Email on Prayer

Hey everyone,

I am so thankful for this group - we had an amazing discussion last night and I feel God was really calling us to take action on what we learned.  Thanks for the openness during our discussion last night - let's be diligent in loving the people around us!

I wanted to follow up on something I shared last night about our prayer time in group.  Going into the fall I had been thinking and praying a lot about our prayer time on Sunday nights, and through a variety of ways, God helped me refine my vision for how we pray together as a group.

Let me start with this: **All prayer is important, and there aren't any prayer requests that are too small to pray about**.  We learned so much during our study on prayer and if anything we want to pray more!

I will also admit that as I shared this last night and as I write this email, I am a little self-conscious that my words will be taken the wrong way.  **I am praying as I send this email that God would make my words clear.**  If my words aren't clear, please talk to me or Emily so we can clarify :)

## What this email isn't

This email is not about discouraging prayer.  This email is not about "cracking down" on our past prayer time.  This email is not about praying less.  This email is not about discouraging people from having prayer requests.

## What this email is

This email is about focusing our prayer time so we can lift each other up more.  This email is about shifting prayer for extended people to outside our normal small group prayer time.  This email is about 1 Thessalonians 5:11 - "So encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing."  This email is about encouraging you to examine your personal life and the lives of your kids and asking your fellow group members to strengthen you in prayer.

## During Small Group Prayer Time

My thoughts for our group prayer time center around *building each other up* and focusing on how we can pray specifically for the members in our group.  I would like to encourage us to think of how our small group can pray for our immediate group and try not to branch out to praying for extended family or friends during our Sunday night prayer time.  This may sound like I don't think we should pray for those requests, but that is not what I think.  We *should* pray more for those type of requests (see the next section), but I am seeing value in focusing the limited time we have during our Sunday night prayer time to lift up each another.

The drive for this change comes from the depths of my heart - because I love this group and want us to strengthen each other.  I think a great way to help strengthen each other is to pray for each other.

## Caveats

I am also not saying we should *never* pray for extended family/friends on a Sunday night - I think there will be exceptions.  But as you think about what you would like the group to pray for, try to focus the request so that we can pray for **you**, and not a person the rest of the group probably doesn't know.  I think if a request for extended family/friends needs a lot of detail and explaining, it might be easier to share that through email instead of during group prayer time.

## Final thoughts

I also wanted to clarify that this is not about adding rules for us to follow (like we learned last night, it's not about the rules!)  This is more of refocusing to make the most out of the time we have for prayer together as a group.


God bless you guys - I hope your next 3 weeks until we meet are filled with the Holy Spirit!
