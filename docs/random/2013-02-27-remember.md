# Remember who you are
*2/27/2013*

I just saw this pretty cool parallel to a verse in our Colossians study in a Disney video, and just thought I'd share it with you.  You can skip the first minute of it, but then after that, listen to the dialog:

In Lesson 7 of our Colossians study, we read the beginning of Colossians 3.  Verse 3 says " For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God."  Think about that verse when you watch the video.

He lives in you.  Remember who you are.  You are God's son/daughter.

God bless!
