# Cancelled
*9/10/2012*
## Intro to this long note

I've been learning a lot this summer about the forgiveness of sins and living free under the blood of Christ.  Some of it has been from sermons I've heard, s
ome from books I've read, and a lot directly from the Bible.  In fact, I'm kind of excited for our upcoming study in Colossians, because one of the key passa
ges I wanted to share is from Colossians.



Anyways - I really wanted to share what I was learning because it really changed how I look at God's forgiveness and I thought maybe it might be an encourage
ment to the group.  If not, sorry for a long, rambling email =) Or maybe this is common knowledge to everyone except me...



## Personal background

Ever since I was little, I was taught that when we sin, we need to confess our sins to God and ask forgiveness.  While I still believe this is true, I think
my understanding of *why* I should do this, is changing.  When confessing a sin to God it always felt like I was cowering before the Almighty, begging Him to
 forgive me.  It was the same feeling when I was little: if I did something real bad and I knew I was going to get punished when we got home, I would plead a
nd beg for mom to forgive me so I could hopefully lessen the punishment.


At the same time, I was taught that God forgives our sins, and "once saved, always saved."

I don't think that I ask God for forgiveness because I'm afraid I'm going to go to hell, but it is a desperate feeling of needing the forgiveness from God af
ter each sin.  But like I said, the things I have been learning this summer are really helping transform my thinking about why I ask God for forgiveness, and
 the true power of His forgiveness.



## Life-changing verse

The verse I read in Colossians really impacted me: [Colossians 2:13-14(NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2%3A13-14&version=NIV)
> "When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the c
harge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross."



That first part makes a lot of sense - we were dead in our sins, but God saved us and made us alive with Christ.  It was verse 14 that hit me:
> "having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness *which stood against us and condemned us*; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross".

The verse says that our legal indebtedness condemned us, *not* God.  I have always kind of pictured God as the lightning-bolt-zapping God waiting to punish t
hose who sin against Him, and I had to beg for forgiveness after I sin.

But this verse makes it clear (to me, at least) that we were indebted to, and condemned by, the law - but God *cancelled* that charge and nailed it to the cr
oss!  The bad guy here is really the devil - he is the one who demands the payment for our sins.  He is the accuser, who accuses us when we sin.  [Galations
3:13(NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galations+3%3A13&version=NIV) says:
> "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us."

[Romans 8:33(NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A33&version=NIV) says:
> "Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies."

God doesn't hold our sin over us and demand payment, the accuser (devil) does. God came and he not only paid our debt - he *cancelled* it.  Just like [Romans
 8:1(NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A1&version=NIV) says:
> "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus"

Once I started thinking in the mindset of the charges of my sin being cancelled (instead of having to be repaid), it really made me think differently about a
sking for forgiveness.





## An example

This example helped make it even more clear to me:



Think of the number of times you have sinned in your life - your entire life.  (in my case, I think it is a pretty big number)



Now think of the number of sins you have confessed to God and asked for forgiveness.



Are those 2 numbers the same?  In my case, the first number was a lot bigger than the second number.



When I pictured my debt to sin, I always pictured it like a monetary debt, where somehow the debt of my sins had to be paid.  Asking God for forgiveness some
how paid that debt.  However, in the context of the 2 numbers above, I was *way* behind in asking for forgiveness, and therefore still in debt.

In the context of the verses I shared above, the debt is gone because Christ cancelled it!  It's hard to understand because in our world, a debt has to be pa
id.  The president couldn't go to all the mortgage companies and just tell them to cancel all the mortgages - someone would have to pay for it - the money ha
s to come from somewhere.  But it's different for God.  He completely did away with our debt - it was gone the moment we asked him to save us.



Another way to think about it:  When Jesus died for my sins back 2000 years ago, how many sins had I committed then?  Zero, because I wasn't even alive yet.
 By cancelling my charges 2000 years ago, there are no longer any charges of debt against the sins I commit today.

That doesn't mean I don't ask for forgiveness though...



## Party like it's 1999?

When I mention that all my sins were forgiven 2000 years ago and I'm "all set" once I ask Christ to save me, it sounds like a free pass to commit sins and be
 off the hook.  To some extent, I think that may even be true: Good things can be abused.  A small example, is those "need a penny take a penny, have a penny
 give a penny" things.  That's a good thing, and it can help people from time to time.  But someone could literally go to each of those things and take all t
he money out.  That doesn't make those things bad - someone was just taking advantage of it.  It's a very small-scale example, but it shows how something goo
d is still good, even if people do bad things with it.

However, if we are in an intimate relationship in-tune with God, we will feel remorse when we bring sin between us and God, and that is why we ask for forgiv
eness.  Asking for forgiveness isn't to ensure our salvation on an ongoing basis.  It is because we brought something bad into our relationship with God, and
 by confessing and asking for forgiveness, we make our relationship right again so we can remain close to Him.

It's kind of like when one of our children is mean to the other child.  The forgiveness part is to repair the relationship between the two of them.  It's not
 like if they don't ask for forgiveness they would get kicked out of the family, or they wouldn't be siblings anymore.  If one child was always mean to the o
ther child and never asked for forgiveness and was never forgiven, that relationship probably wouldn't be good once they got older.



It is about the mending of a relationship: If we are in a close relationship with God, we will want to confess and ask for forgiveness so we can be close aga
in.



## What about ongoing sin?

The only part about all of the above that is hard for me is the habitual sin.  The "cyclic" sins - the ones where you sin, ask for forgiveness, and then find
 yourself in that same sin again.

Here is my take on those:  I believe that the feeling of remorse after sinning the same sin for the umpteenth time is the Holy Spirit reminding you that ther
e is something between you and God.  The fact that you ask for forgiveness is a sign that you want to make things right with God, and that you are growing in
 God.  Keep on growing in God and asking for forgiveness.  If it is a lifelong sin that you just can't beat, maybe try seeking a good Christian friend for ac
countability.

I guess the point I am trying to make in this paragraph is that I believe when we were saved, Christ has already died for ALL of our sins, even when we keep
committing them.  Being forgiven of these habitual sins helps make our relationship closer to God.



If you *ever* feel under attack from sins you have committed in the past, just know that Satan is the one who is reminding you of this, because God destroyed
 the whole *system* of debt to sin (like I mentioned above).

You are no longer dead in your sins, but redeemed by the blood of Jesus!



## A song



I really like the lyrics to the song ["Beautiful Things"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1spkhp41ig4) by Gungor.

Here are the lyrics:

> All this pain

> I wonder if I'll ever find my way

> I wonder if my life could really change at all

> All this earth

> Could all that is lost ever be found

> Could a garden come up from this ground at all


> &nbsp;


> You make beautiful things

> You make beautiful things out of the dust

> You make beautiful things

> You make beautiful things out of us


> &nbsp;


> All around

> Hope is springing up from this old ground

> Out of chaos life is being found in You


> &nbsp;


> You make me new, You are making me new

> You make me new, You are making me new

> You are making me new


Here is why I like this song:  We were saved by God.  He *cancelled* the charges of our sin.  Only our Awesome God has the power to take us (when we can make
 such a mess of our lives) and make us *innocent* again.  He has the power to actually take us back to innocence, like a newborn baby.  He makes us new, as $
hough we had never sinned.



## Wrapping up

This note is super long, and I pray that God is somehow able to use my jumbled mess of words, and make them clear to you as you read it.

I pray that maybe it can impact you like it is impacting me.  It is like I don't live in fear of offending God anymore, but after I sin, I have the opportuni
ty to make my relationship right with Him again.

He loves us so much that He literally washed our sins away so we are as white as snow - innocent as a baby, like we have never sinned.  He cast our sins as f
ar as the East is from the West ([Psalm 103:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+103%3A12&version=NIV)).  How far is that?  The Voyager 1 s
pacecraft from NASA is the farthest man-made object from Earth.  It has been traveling away from Earth since 1977, and it is still traveling away from Earth
at a speed of about 10 miles per second.  It is more than 11,300,000,000 miles away (as of September 2012) from Earth and getting farther away all the time.
 AND, it is still inside our Galaxy (that just shows how small we are in the context of space).  Imagine if NASA had released another spacecraft in the exact
 opposite direction - those two would be SUPER far away from each other.  Imagine they travel away from each other for 1,000 years.  That's not even a fracti
on of how far the east is from the west.  That is how far God removed our sins from us.  In other words - your sins are gone.


## Summary

As a Christian - you are free from your sins, free from the charge of those sins, and in a relationship with the God who made you free.  God wants to love us
, not punish us.  Once I started viewing God like this, it really started to change my relationship with Him, and maybe this email can help change your view
of Him as well?



Thanks for putting up with this long note.

God bless!
