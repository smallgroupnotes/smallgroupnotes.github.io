# Something more on prayer
*12/11/2013*

I was listening to a sermon tonight while I was driving, and it had something in it that I thought related to our study on prayer, so I thought I would share it.  The sermon wasn't about prayer  - it was about how we serve a God of the unexpected.  

Since it is near Christmas he was talking about the birth of Jesus and how the Jews were expecting their messiah to be a mighty warrior to deliver them from the Romans.  Instead, he was born to a poor girl, visited by poor shepherds, and had nothing "expected" about Him.  Nothing happened the way the Jews were praying and expecting it to happen.

Towards the end of the sermon, he was saying to keep your eyes open for the unexpected.  We use the phrase "putting God in a box" which is basically saying you expect God to do something a certain way... But we should know that he does things unexpected, so don't try to expect God to behave a certain way.

The part that related to our prayer study was this: in our fallen state, we like to run things and control things our way.  We feel secure when we are in charge.  This is essentially trying to be lord of our own life.  

We need to cast our cares on Him, trusting that he will meet our needs.
When we pray, we need to *keep our eyes open for the unexpected*. If we think we know how he is going to answer a prayer, we are probably going to miss the answer to the prayer.  Pray with your eyes open to how God might surprise you.

This reminded me of one of our earlier studies on praying along with God's will, and how sometimes we pray for what *we* want God's will to be.  I thought this little part of this sermon matched up with what we talked about, so I thought I would pass it on.

I hope you all have a great rest of the week!
