# Creation Confusion
## Introduction
* Is it possible to be a rational person that also takes the story of Genesis 1 seriously?
* A majority of young people who leave their faith state that they leave because Christians were too confident they had all of the answers
* Faith goes beyond reason but not against reason
* Michael Gungor wrote a post called "[What do we believe](http://www.gungormusic.com/blog/2014/02/what-do-we-believe)" questioning the 6 literal days of creation, which caused many Christians to reject him and his music
* Sometimes issues turn into a litmus test for salvation
> Litmus Test: a test in which a single factor is decisive

## Jesus, Dogma, Doctrine, Opinion

![Circles](/images/Circles.png)

* Not all beliefs are equally important
* When we want to know what God looks like, we look to the cross
* The Dogma's of the Christian faith are the creeds
> Dogma: a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true.
* Doctrine deals more with denominations
* Be a firm center with soft edges.
	* You can stick to your guns towards the center of the circle but as you progress to the outside of the circles you should be more flexible

## Views of creation
* Our dogma of creation:
	* That God Created
	* He created by his *word*
	* Creation was good but was affected by sin
	* People have value and are made in God's image
* Opinion of *how* God created
	* Fiat Creation: God spoke creation into existence in 6 literal days
	* Progressive Creation: God created all of the species and used evolution to complete (micro evolution)
	* Theistic Evolution: God birthed everything into existence and was a part of the evolutionary process
* Opinion of *when* God created
	* Young earth view: Earth is 6/7 thousand years old
	* Day-age view: Earth very old - each day of creation represents thousands or millions of years
	* Restoration (Gap) view: Earth millions of years old.  A gap between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2
	* Literary framework view: Genesis isn't conveying scientific facts but instead literary views of who God is
* If we aren't talking about the fact "that God created" we are probably in the "opinion" circle and we should discuss rather than divide

## A look into Genesis 1:1-5
* beresheet: "In \[the\] beginning"
* tohu vavohu: "unseen and unformed"
* tehom: "the deep or abyss"
* Things this text is not trying to say
	* Not trying to inform us of the beginning of all time
		* [A lot of research](https://www.google.com/search?q=genesis+1%3A1+"in+a+beginning") states that beresheet also means "in *a* beginning"
	* Not defending Creation ex Nihilo (Creation from nothing)
	* Not explaining how matter came into existence

## Interpreting Genesis 1
* If Genesis 1 is not telling us how or why God created the world, what is it telling us?

* If Genesis 1 is the description of what the universe is like, there are scientific problems (for example, the stars and moon are not stuck into a firmament above the earth)
* If the cosmology of Genesis 1 appears to be incorrect, we can look at the story as a literary work
* Comparing Genesis 1 to other creation stories of the same time period can help us understand better

## Genesis 1 versus the [Enuma Elish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En%C3%BBma_Eli%C5%A1)
* Similarities:
	* 6 day creation
	* Creation out of chaos
	* Sequence similarities
	* Cosmological similarities
* Differences:
	* Creation by divine word versus divine word
	* The singularity of God's rule
	* Humanities place in the narrative
	* The concept of the Sabbath
* The message of Genesis 1 becomes clear when we stop trying to look at it as a scientific document
* Genesis 1 is a theological declaration of who our God is
* Science can try to explain the how, but can't explain the *why* or the purpose
* Walter Brueggemann:
> This text is not a scientific description but a theological affirmation. The poem does not narrate ‘how it happened,’ as though Israel were interested in the method of how the world became God’s world. Such a way of treating the grand theme of creation is like reducing the marvel of any moving artistic experience to explorations in technique. Israel is concerned with God’s lordly intent, not his technique.

## Conclusion
* The good news of Genesis 1 is that the God we serve has no rivals!
	* This sets Genesis 1 apart from all other creation stories
* God can create new beginnings from the chaos
* Science and faith do not have to be rivals
	* God created science, and if he has no rivals, wouldn't he be okay with us asking questions about it?
	* The deeper we dig the closer we grow to God
* If God has no rivals and we are in his image and we are empowered with his Holy Spirit, then what was true at the time of creation is true about you today
* When we are in the middle of chaotic waters we can trust that the God of the universe does not view that as a rival - he has victory and can breathe something new out of the chaos
* The way God creates is through his Word and John 1:1 says that Jesus is the Word of God
