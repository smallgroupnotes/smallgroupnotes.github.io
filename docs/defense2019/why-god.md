# Why God?
## Introduction

* Why believe in God?  Are there reasons for believing in God?
* When you think through things and own it for yourself, you tend to be more passionate about it

## Arguments for God's existence

###  Argument #1 - [Fine Tuning Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe) (Goldilocks argument)

* For life to exist in our universe, many things had to be *just right*
* [Psalms 19:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2019:1&version=NLT) - The heavens declare God's handiwork
* [Psalms 14:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2014:1&version=NLT) - Fools say there is no God
* Cosmic Constants:
> The stability of our world is the result of many forces of nature interacting with each other in specific ways. If these interactions had been any different, life (and matter itself) would not have happened. Each one of these forces that acts up on the world is called a Cosmic Constant.

#### Examples of Comsic Constants

1. Ratio of electromagnetic force constant.
> 1 in 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 chance of being able to support life.  Modify that number by adding 1 or subtracting 1 and life would not be possible
2. Strong nuclear force constant
3. Weak nuclear force constant 
4. Gravitational force constant

* All of these cosmic constants (currently around 47 accepted comsic constants) need to be *just right* in order to support life

#### Fine Tuning the Big Bang

* Big Bang Theory - citing [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang):
	* Around 13.8 billion years ago all of the matter of the universe was contained in a tiny condensed ball of matter which exploded to create the universe
* Some scientists hoped the universe was an [oscillating universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_model) where gravity would eventually pull all of the matter back into a condensed ball of matter and start the "big bang" again, but that was ruled out when it was discovered that the expansion of our universe is accelerating, not slowing down
* What are the chances that you can get all 47 cosmic constants right in just *one try*? 
	* Imagine very big dice with 10^40 sides to it.  The odds of rolling a 17 are 1 in 10^40 power.  What are the chances that you could roll a 17 **47 times in a row**?  Don't roll a 17 any one of those times and life is not possible.
* Anyone would conclude that there are external forces (someone with intelligence) involved if you could roll a 3 in dice 10 times in a row.  Why would you not also conclude that there is an intelligent creator to "roll" the perfect universe of a 10^40 sided-die **47 times in a row**?
* It is a reasonable conclusion that there is a God behind the universe.
* The only way around this conclusion is that there are infinite universes and *our* universe is the one that can support life.
	* There is no evidence for this theory.
* It seems to take more faith to assume that chance could bring about our world instead of the faith it takes to assume that God created it

## Argument #2 - [Anthropological argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument)

* Anthropological argument: We learn something about God and His existence from the way in which we are made. Human beings are rational, intelligent beings - reflecting, in some ways, their Creator.
* **Cut for time:** He talked for a long time about when he walked away from God - he came to the conclusion that he was just a product of evolution, which he concluded that he had no purpose or meaning.
* If nature were to evolve beings that had needs, you would believe that nature would supply the answer to those needs
* Where did our longing for reason, meaning, and morality come from?  This longing is out of place in the evolutionary universe.
* If there *is* a rational, moral being that created the universe, we can begin to understand why we have these longings

## Conclusion

* According to the big God story - our rational, moral God created us, became one of us, and took our sin from us - all with the purpose of Jesus Christ.
* Jesus is the reason for everything - he is our purpose.  Our fulfilment can be found in him
* We have all the reasons to believe that God's story is true - and that makes our future very bright.
* Can we prove beyond all doubt that this story is true?  No - but it takes more faith (with the given evidence) that there is no God.
* If this story is true - make it the most important thing in your life - make Jesus the reason for everything you do - he is the revelation of the designer of the universe.
