# Why the Bible?
## *The Bible's perfect imperfection*

## Intro

* We worship God with our heart, soul, strength, and *mind* ([Mark 12:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+12%3A30&version=NLT))
* When we wrestle with issues and think passionately about the Bible we are worshipping God.
* Why believe in the Bible?
    * Don't use circular reasoning to justify your belief in the Bible

## The argument for Biblical inspiration

* Food for thought: Rather than basing your belief in Jesus on the Bible - base your belief in the Bible on Jesus
* There are strong, historical reasons to believe in Jesus and that Jesus is Lord
* Jesus believed that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God (He frequently quoted the OT, and even quoted God speaking in the OT.  Also, see [Luke 24:44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+24%3A44&version=NLT))
* Jesus also pre-authorized the New Testament (See [John 16:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A12&version=NLT), [John 14:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A26&version=NLT) for examples)
* If we confess that Jesus is Lord and he believed the OT and NT were inspired by God, we must also believe that OT and NT were inspired by God.
* [2 Timothy 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+3%3A16&version=NLT) - All scripture is God breathed

## The doctrine of inerrancy 

Inerrancy:
> lack of error; infallibility

* Many evangelicals (who believe that the Bible is God breathed) believe that any inaccuracies or mistakes in the Bible must only be perceived and they try to explain them away.
    * They believe that a perfect God would breathe a perfect book
* This view could be dangerous
    * It sets people up for a fall
    * If you believe that the Bible is free from any error but later are presented with evidence that there are errors that you can't explain, you assume that maybe it isn't divinely inspired and therefore Jesus was wrong for endorsing the Bible as God's word
* This message will examine some errors and contradictions that are found in the Bible
* It will also show that these errors *contribute* to the inspiration of the Bible

## "Problems" in the Bible

* It is a perfectly imperfect book

### Problem #1 - Ancient (Pre-Scientific) Cosmology

* Examples:
    * The writers of the OT believed the sky was a hard dome that held up water ([Job 37:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+37%3A18&version=NLT), [Genesis 1:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A7&version=NLT))
    * They believed God opened windows in the dome to produce rain ([Malachi 3:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+3%3A10&version=NLT))
    * Mythological Sea Monsters ([Psalm 74:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+74%3A14&version=NLT), [Job 41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+41&version=NLT))
    * These writers were correct that there were evil forces threatening the earth but they were misplaced in what these forces actually were

### Problem #2 - Contradictions in the Bible
* [2 Samuel 24:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+24%3A1&version=NLT) says that God caused David to sin by having him take a census of his army.  This is later corrected in [1 Chronicles 21:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Chronicles+21%3A1&version=NLT) where it says that it was Satan that incited David to take the census
* [Exodus 34:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34%3A7&version=NLT) & [Numbers 14:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+14%3A18&version=NLT) say that God judges generations based on their parents’/ancestors’ sins, but [Ezekiel 18:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+18%3A20&version=NLT) says that God will **not** judge generations based on their parents’/ancestors’/ sins
* Evidence of a progress of revelation - early on the authors didn't understand God enough but later on authors had a deeper relationship with God

### Problem #3 - Human Mistakes

* [1 Corinthians 1:14-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+1%3A14-16&version=NLT) - Paul changes his story within these verses
* [Mark 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201:2&version=NLT) - Mark quotes a Scripture reference and says it’s from Isaiah…but it is actually from [Malachi 3:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi%203:1&version=NLT)
* [Mark 2:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%202:26&version=NLT) - Jesus references an incident that took place under “ Abiathar the high priest,” but the high priest during this instance was actually Abiathar’s father – Ahimelech in [1 Samuel 21:1-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2021:1-6&version=NLT)
* [Matthew 27:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027:9&version=NLT) (**NOTE: Speaker says Jeremy instead of Jeremiah**) - Jesus references a scripture from Jeremiah…but it was actually found in [Zachariah 11:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zachariah%2011:13&version=NLT), not Jeremiah

### Problem #4 - Un-Christ-like Pictures of God

* [Deuteronomy 20:16-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2020:16-17&version=NLT) - God commands the death of men, women, children, and, animals

## We should try not to assume what a perfect God would do

* It makes sense to common reason that a perfect God would write a perfect book - but multiple examples in scripture show that God/Jesus does things opposite of what people expect
    * The disciples (and early Jews) assumed what the messiah would do - but Jesus did the opposite
* Rather than assuming what it means for a perfect God to breathe a revelation of himself - it is wiser to let God teach us
* One of the places to learn is the place where God fully reveals himself - on the cross

## Consideration #1 - God's perfect revelation on the cross

* What would it look like for God to reveal his power?  Most people would assume it would be impressive, but when God reveals his power it appears foolish ([1 Corinthians 1:18,24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:18,24&version=NLT))
> The message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for destruction! But we who are being saved know it is the very power of God.

* If God revealed himself through Christ on the cross, who embodied everything that is wrong with this world, why would we assume that the scripture (that is designed to point people *to* the cross) should be free of imperfections?
* If God breathed his fullest revelation through something that appears foolish and weak (read [1 Corinthians 1:18,24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:18,24&version=NLT) again) shouldn't we expect the Bible to include foolish and weak things?
* The Bible *should* contain sin and imperfections because it points to the cross

## Consideration  #2 - God's breathing is not unilateral
* *Unilateral:*
> An action or decision performed by or affecting only one person, group, or country involved in a particular situation, without the agreement of another or the others.

* To assume that God would breathe a perfect book assumes that God and *God only* breathes into the Bible and nothing else gets mixed in with what God breathes.
* The Bible was not unilaterally-breathed - it is relationally-breathed - this is why the Bible gets mixed up with imperfect stuff
* God on the cross involves allows imperfect people to act towards him and condition how he appears
* God on the cross allows all of the imperfections of humanity to act on him
* The cross is both beautiful and ugly
    * Beautiful because it reveals God acting towards us, to become what is opposite of himself, out of love for us
    * Ugly because it allows people to act towards him.  The cross mirrors the ugliness of the sin of the world
* The Bible will look beautiful to the degree that it reflects God acting towards us and it will look ugly (and imperfect and weak) to the degree that it reflects humanity acting towards God.

## Imperfections in the Bible reveal God's love

* If God can breathe his perfect revelation through the one who bears all of the sins and imperfections of the world, why would we think it is a problem that God could breathe through the imperfections of the authors of the Bible?
* These imperfections confirm what the cross reveals about God: God enters into solidarity with us and uses us as we are
* God manifests his perfection through human imperfections, his beauty through human ugliness, his holiness through human sin.
* God has always been a God who has been willing to bear the sin and imperfection of his people and take on an appearance of sin and imperfection

## Encouragement

* If God can breathe his revelation through people who look foolish and infallible then there is hope for us!
    * God loves you and can use you as you are
* If God only used perfect people we wouldn't have a Bible
* Let God use you in spite of your imperfections - him using you will than begin the process of perfecting you!

## Conclusion

* The Bible is infallible if you read it with the purpose God intended - which is to lead people to Jesus (centered on the cross)
* Reading the Bible with any other agenda (scientific, historical, etc) will let you down
* Reading the Bible with the purpose of being led to Jesus will turn the problems into assets
* The errors and contradictions don't detract from the Bible - they contribute to it by pointing to the cross
