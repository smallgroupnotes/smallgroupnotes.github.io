# What is Truth?

## Introduction

* People "lose their faith" for various reasons, but most of these reasons stem from misunderstandings or a lack of knowledge.
* This series should equip us to be able to respond to objections to Christianity

## History of "relative truth"
* John 18:37-38 - **What is Truth?**

* This question is asked a lot today - our culture is in a culture of truth.

### History:

* Many wars in the 1500s-1600s resulted in the "Peace of Westphalia" - you can't kill people for religious motives.
* This is when tolerance was introduced in western cultures.
* In the past, most people lived very isolated lives where they weren't exposed to other parts of the world.
* With advances in technology we are exposed to many more beliefs, lifestyles, and cultures
* This brings relative truth - truth is relative to each person
* People who claim to know absolute truths (truths that apply to everyone) are viewed as arrogant and narrow minded.

## Some responses to people who believe that truth is relative and Christians are arrogant and narrow minded 

### Response #1 - Our core belief should be in God's Love

* Religious beliefs can be dangerous
* If someone holds a belief as the greatest good, they eventually begin to feel justified killing others who do not believe this way
* Exception: Holding the greatest belief that God is love and we should always show love
* Jesus Christ is Lord is the one belief that could never lead to violence

### Response #2 - Relativism is self-refuting

* Example: There is no absolute truth - Or - All truth is relative
* Sometimes (if you have a good relationship with the person!) it can help to show people how their relativism is self-refuting

### Response #3 - Truth is always narrow - don't feel bad for holding to a "narrow" view

* Truth is always singular - error is infinite
* Example: 2+2 has 1 (narrow?) answer, but infinite wrong answers
* It is not *what* you believe that makes you open or narrow minded, but *why* you believe it.
* If you hold a belief because you were told it was true and you never research it or look at other perspectives, that could be narrow minded.
* Hold to the absolute truth that Jesus is Lord, but know why you believe what you believe.  And remain open to dialog and discussion.

### Response #4 - There is only one reality (No one actually believes relativism)

* You can tell what a person believes by how they act
* People who believe in relativism cannot live like there are no absolute truths or that everything is relative
* There is a shared reality that apply to everyone - truth can only be relative if reality is relative
* Relative morality - what is right for someone might not be right for someone else
	* Everyone knows and assumes that there are moral truths that apply to *everyone*
	* There is a "moral code" that transcends nations and personal preference

### Response #5 - Jesus made absolute truth claims

* If Jesus is right, this proves that not all truths are relative
* John 14:6 - Jesus said He was **THE** way, truth and life - this is absolute - he is either right or wrong - there is no middle ground of him being *one* of the ways to God
* Acts 4:11-12 - Jesus is the *foundation* for everything God is building and there is salvation is **no one else**.  This is another absolute truth
* There is only one saviour and his name is Jesus.  His name is above *all* names.  
* These truths sound narrow (because they are), but they are no less narrow than saying all truth is relative

## Closing

* There is an increasing prejudice against people who make absolute truth claims
* Hold to your beliefs, just not in an arrogant and narrow minded way
* It is important to know why you believe something is true
* Be humble and loving as you hold your truths
* Be secure in your faith so you aren't afraid if people ask you questoins about what you believe
* 1 Cor 16:14 - Do everything in love
