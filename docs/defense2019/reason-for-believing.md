# Reason for Believing

* Pre-read: [John 20:1-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+20%3A1-10&version=NLT)

## Intro

* Believing that Jesus rose from the dead is a tall order
* At first, the experience with God is good enough but experiences can be subjective.  Eventually people may need objective reasons to believe something is true.

## Four indisputable historical facts to backup the resurrection of Jesus:

1. In the mid-first century, Jewish believers worshipped and proclaimed Jesus as Creator, Savior, and God.
2. The Jewish faith of these early believers was radically transformed.
3. These early Christians underwent terrible persecution.
4. The Christian movement originated and quickly spread in the same region as Jesus lived, taught, and died.

## Three ways to explain the resurrection of Jesus:
1. The story is true!
2. The story is a hoax
3. The story is a legend

## Problems with the "hoax theory":

1. No motive: The disciples had nothing to gain from lying.
2. No means: The disciples and gospel authors use names and details that could easily be checked out.
3. No evidence they made up the story. (As soon as persecution starts someone usually recants if the story isnâ€™t true.)
4. Much evidence against the idea they made it up.

## Problems with the "legend theory": 

1. Not enough time for a legend to develop.
2. Jewish culture is resistant to the development of legends of a diety.
3. Numerous Eyewitness seeing Jesus over a period of 40 days.
4. Five early and independent accounts.
5. The accounts pass the standard of historical trustworthiness.

## Conclusion

* If Jesus has indeed been raised then the most important question you can ask yourself is, what is my relationship to Jesus?
* If we have historical proof that Jesus was alive and was raised from the dead, this should solidify the accuracy of the rest of gospel
