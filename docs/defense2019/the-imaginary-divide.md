# The Imaginary Divide

## Intro

* Science and Faith are complimentary (there *are* points of contention)

* Assumption: Faith and Science are at war
    * Science is rational and logical and evidence
    * Faith is irrational and basing conclusions on authority


* Statistics ([David Kinnaman - You Lost Me](https://www.amazon.com/You-Lost-Me-Christians-Rethinking/dp/0801015898)):
    * 59% of Americans believe science often conflicts with religious faith
    * 39% of Americans believe science mostly conflicts with religious faith
    * 97% of scientists believe humans have evolved
    * 24% of American evangelicals believe humans have evolved
    * 59% of Americans will walk away from their faith

* Respect towards science is increasing in our culture (disrespect for groups that reject science increases)
* As ambassadors of the kingdom, this "obstacle" to faith should concern us

## Worshiping God with our minds
* [Matthew 22:37-38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mathew+22%3A37-38&version=NLT) - Love God with your whole heart, soul, and **mind**
    * The mind was *created* to think
    * We are to worship God with our thinking
    * When we are thinking deeply about God, we are worshiping him with our mind
* [Acts 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+1%3A3&version=NLT) - Jesus *proved* to the disciples he was alive
    * Jesus didn't expect his disciples to believe he had risen just because he said so
    * Knowing they had minds, he gave them proof and evidence
* [1 Peter 3:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+3%3A15&version=NLT) - Always be ready to make your defense for your faith
    * If someone wants to know why you believe in Jesus, God expects us to be able to give a reason for that
    * Apologia: a formal written defense of one's opinions or conduct

## Beliefs that match reality

* ***Fideism:***  - *the idea that religious faith and reason are incompatible with each other*
* Karl Barth is a fideist who says:
> “Belief that the Bible is the word of God presupposes that the Bible has already proved itself to be the word of God. But when there is this proof it must be a matter of the word of God itself. We have to recognize that faith is a miracle and it’s a miracle which we cannot explain apart from faith, or rather, apart from the word of God in which the faith believes. Therefore the reality and possibility [of faith] cannot be maintained or defended at all part from faith and the word.” 
    
* This argument (the Bible has already proved itself to be the word of God) is circular - you are using the conclusion to defend the conclusion
* We need to be able to give a defense for why we have the hope that we have (other than just stating reciting the fact that we have that hope.
    * Our reasons should be anchored outside faith
* If why we believe what we believe isn't a rational consideration - then why believe it?
    * Without thinking about your beliefs, it just seems like you inherited your beliefs by chance
* We want our beliefs to match reality - believe in what is true
    * You can't determine truth by chance
    * The only way to get to truth is by examining, thinking, and coming to conclusions
* The importance of this series:
    * The assumption in our culture that faith being irrational is growing

## Reason **plus** faith

* Example: a group hiking up a mountain becomes trapped and has to find their way down the mountain
    * This group has to use reason and logic to determine the way out
* Reasoning can point you in the direction of truth, but it can't get you all the way there - you will have to make a leap - a commitment
* Faith goes beyond reason, but not against it
* You may believe things that seem to defy reason, but you have good reasons to affirm them
* You *have* to act as though something is true even if it isn't proven yet
    * To make no decision is actually still making a decision

## Faith is not just for religious people
* If we are interested in finding out the truth we need to ask questions - but at some point you need to act.
* Even if you don't act, you are exercising faith
* There is no non-faith way of responding to life
* Every rational person is a person of faith
    * Everyone has to act on the assumption of certain things being true that they cannot prove
* Even scientists have faith
    * They deal with foundation assumptions that they cannot prove
    * Some scientists commit their whole lives trying to prove something they believe is true
* If every rational person has to beyond the evidence but not against it, then believing in Jesus is no different than what everyone else does in their lives

## Conclusion
* Do you know why you believe what you believe?
* We are ambassadors of the kingdom and evangelists - we should be able to give a reason for the hope within us
* Challenge: 
    * Go to an unbeliever and ask if you can speak to them of why you believe what you believe, and ask them to poke holes in it
