# Simon Peter and Andrew
*10/17/2021*

## Question for the night: Is Jesus Playful?

### Chronology notes
The gospels are not clear on the exact chronology of the stories of when Jesus met Peter and Andrew. 
* Matthew and Mark both say Jesus was walking along the Sea of Galilee when he called Peter and Andrew and later called James and John (sons of Zebedee).
* Luke says Jesus was teaching by the sea when he saw all 4 fishermen working together.
* John does not mention the men fishing – only that Andrew (Peter’s brother) met Jesus through John the Baptist, and then Andrew introduced Peter to Jesus.

## Jesus calls Simon and Andrew (and  James and John)

[Mark 1:16-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+1%3A16-20&version=NLT)

## Parable of the fish

## The playfulness of Jesus
* What do you think Jesus' mood was during this story? [John 21:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+21%3A1-11&version=NLT)
* He simply stands on the shore, hands in his pockets, and asks the question: “Catch anything?” (verse 4)
* “Try the other side.” Again the nets are bursting. It’s how he lets them know it’s him.  This is a running gag between friends where over time all you need to do is start the first line and everyone cracks up all over again.
* Do you see the playfulness of Jesus? His timing, the tension, his hiddenness, a touristlike question, the same lame suggestion from somebody they think knows nothing about fishing, then bang!—the catch. And the boys are hooked again. This is a beautiful story, made so much richer because of the playfulness of Jesus.
* Playful, funny, so human, so hopeful, so unreligious. And it is that particular quality that gives the passage its true character and gives us an essential for knowing Jesus as he really is. The man is not religious. If he were, the story would have taken place in a religious setting—the temple, perhaps, or at least a synagogue.

## For the kids:
* Reminder that Simon = Peter
* See if you can count how many times Jesus smiled or laughed in the clip.
* After the clip, read Luke 5:1-11
* Do you think Jesus smiled and laughed when he filled their boat with fish?
* Did you notice Mary Magdalene?  She became a follower of Jesus after he healed her.
