# Small Group Notes
<br />

## What is this site?

This site was just a way for me to document some of the things we have discussed as a small group.  Many of the posts here are emails that I have sent out to the group.

## How do I navigate this site?

<!-- There is a navigation bar at the top of the page that is categorized by the studies we have done.  Click on one of the categories and select a page from the menu. -->

The bar on the left side of this site is categorized by studies we have done, with each study listed under that category.

One of the categories displayed is "Random Emails" - these are just some random emails I have sent to the group.

Once you are reading a page under a specific study, there are "Next" and "Previous" buttons at the bottom <!-- top --> of each page.

## How do I search for content?

There is a search box at the upper-left corner of the site - just type in a search term and hit enter

<!-- Right now, searching is not an option - it will hopefully be available soon -->
