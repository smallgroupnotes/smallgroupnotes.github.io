# Small Group Notes
A collection of thoughts we have shared in our small group at church.

## What is this site?

This site was just a way for me to document some of the things we have discussed as a small group.  Many of the posts here are emails that I have sent out to the group.

## How do I navigate this site?

The bar on the left side of this site is categorized by studies we have done, as well as some random emails that have been sent.

Once you are reading a page under a specific study, there are "Next" and "Previous" buttons at the bottom of each page.

## How do I search for content?

There is a search box at the upper-left corner of the site - just type in a search term and hit enter
