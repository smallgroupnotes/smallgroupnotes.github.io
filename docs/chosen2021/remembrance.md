# Remembrance

*April 10, 2022*

### Emily with the kids

* Sin & Forgiveness
* No video for the kids this week.

### Adults - intro

* A lot packed into tonight.  We won't study some of the first verses in much detail
* We will study a passage in depth towards the end
* Holy week: A perfect time to remember why Jesus came to save us and what He did for us
* Reality: Jesus forgave us of our sins
* Reality: We still sin
* Read [Romans 7:21-8:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A21-8%3A2&version=NLT)
* Read [1 John 2:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A1-2&version=NLT)
* Read [Romans 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23&version=NLT)

### Video: Mary Magdalene relapse

* Intro before video
	* The original reason I didn't include this video in my list of stories to study is because it is not in the Bible
	* When preparing for tonight I realized that the reality is that everyone struggles with sin (just like the verses above) so while this story may not be found in the Bible, backsliding is a familiar story that depicts what real people struggle with.
* Watch "Mary Magdalene Relapse 1" (Episode 14 on Plex) from The Chosen

### Sin is a big deal

* Sin is anything that misses the mark and falls short of God's righteousness
* [Isaiah 59:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+59%3A2&version=NLT)
* [Romans 6:23a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A23&version=NLT)
* [Hebrews 12:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12%3A1&version=NLT)
* [Hebrews 9:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+9%3A7&version=NLT)

#### Address our own sins

* Take time to sit in the tension of the fact that we still sin and need God's forgiveness
* This is not a time to beat ourselves up.
* It *is* a time to be real with ourselves and look for areas in our lives where we fall short - to be serious about our sins

### Video: Matthew and Simon find Mary

* When we have been forgiven of so much, how can we not be joyful?
* Watch "Mary Magdalene Relapse 2" (Episode 15 on Plex) from The Chosen
* Mary realized her sin was a big deal - but she also hadn't clicked for her yet that God's forgiveness and grace is bigger.

### Video: Mary is forgiven

* Watch "Mary Magdalene Relapse 3" (Episode 16 on Plex) from The Chosen
* "Well, that's not much of a redemption if it can be lost in a day, is it?"
* "I just can't live up to it"... "Well, that's true - but you don't have to.  I just want your heart."

### Forgiven

* [Psalm 32:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+32%3A1-2&version=NLT) This is why it is important to know the seriousness of our sin: So that we can contrast it with God's grace, and live in Joy! 
* [Psalm 103:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+103%3A12&version=NLT)
* [1 Peter 2:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A24&version=NLT)
* [Hebrews 8:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+8%3A12&version=NLT)
* [Titus 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+2%3A14&version=NLT)

### Study the Bible

* Since it is Holy week, a good passage to study would be the last supper.  To remember what He has done for us
* [1 Corinthians 11:23-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11%3A23-26&version=NLT)
