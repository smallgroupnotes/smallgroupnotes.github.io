## Follow-up from last week
* Jewish Eruv

> An eruv integrates a number of private properties and spaces such as streets and sidewalks into one larger "private domain" by surrounding it... thereby avoiding restrictions of transferring between domains.

> An eruv allows Jews to carry, among other things, house keys, tissues, medication, or babies with them, and to use strollers and canes.

* Manhattan's eruv costs about $200,000/year to maintain
* This line has been in place for over a century
* A single break in any part of the line voids that symbolic space.

* Rules like this is what Jesus was talking about when he said that the Sabbath was not created to put burdens on people, but instead to give them rest.

## For the kids
* Read [Luke 6:1-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6%3A1-5&version=NLT)
* Video setup: It picks up where we left off last week
* Do you think God created the Sabbath to make it harder for his people to do things like eat?
* God gave us a day of rest so that we could... rest.  But the pharisees made a lot of rules about the Sabbath
* "I desire mercy, not sacrifice"
	* In some ways, it is easy to sacrifice.
	* Give money to those in need
	* The animal sacrifices in the Old Testament
	* Are those things really merciful?
	* Mercy means getting our heart involved
	* Mercy usually involves personal sacrifice, but sacrifice does not always mean mercy
* We talked a lot about the rules we sometimes follow that prevent us from loving others.  This week, think about what kind of ways we might take the easy way out instead of showing mercy and love to others.
