## For the kids
* What kind of things are important in to us in our lives?
* What kind of things do we argue about?
* Read [Matthew 4:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+4%3A24&version=NIV)

#### Video setup:

* We will see a large group of people.
* We will see Jesus' disciples setting up camp, and Jesus' mom, Mary comes
* The disciples have a bit of an argument about Matthew

#### Watch Video

* Jesus' ministry was about sacrifice.
	* He sacrificed his time, his comfort, and ultimately his life, just so he could love people
* In the video, Jesus' disciples were arguing.
* After Jesus walked by, how much did those things they were arguing about matter?
* Jesus reminded them by his example of what really matters in our lives.
* What things really matter?
