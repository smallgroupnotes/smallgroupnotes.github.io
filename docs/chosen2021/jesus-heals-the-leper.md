## For the kids

#### Background on leprosy 

* Leprosy - a disease of the skin that could be very serious - thankfully today we have medicine that can completely heal it, but back then, they didn't.
* The law back then said that people with leprosy had to stay 150 feet away from other people so they wouldn't spread it.
* (Remember Covid, we were told to stay 6 feet away from people?)

* Imagine what it would feel like to be a person with leprosy - you couldn't ever get close your family - the only people you could get close to were other lepers.
* Imagine not being able to be hugged ever again.

#### Bible verses

* Read Mark 1:40-44

#### The video
* Watch "The Leper" (Episode 4 on Plex) from The Chosen

#### Thoughts

* Before Jesus healed the man with leprosy, he reached out and touched him.  What would that be like - if you couldn't ever be touched again, and the kindest man you have ever seen reached out and touched you?

* Even though we don't have leprosy, are there things that make you feel like no one would want to be around you?  Jesus doesn't care what we have done or what diseases we have - he has compassion for us because he loves us - he would love to reach out and hug us when we feel like no one else would want to.

* How would you feel if you were the one of the disciples and the man with leprosy "suddenly appeared" - would you be afraid? (If you caught it, you could never be near your family again).
* Are there people around us that people don't want to be around?  How can Jesus give them a hug?  He can use YOU to give them a hug, say kind words, or let them know that someone cares about them.
