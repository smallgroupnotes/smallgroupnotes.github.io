### Video description:

* The video picks up with Jesus healing the man with leprosy – someone who saw this had a friend who needed healing.
* The video introduces some new people (it will show their names) that we haven’t met yet:  Matthew, the pharisees, and Nicodemus (a pharisee).
* Jesus will go to the house of Zebedee (James and John’s dad) and more and more people come to hear him teach.

### After the video

* When the man’s friends lowered him down in front of Jesus, what was the first thing Jesus did? 
    * Forgave his sins
    * Jesus cares so much about our health and safety, but he cares even more for our eternal heart.
* How happy do you think the man’s friends were?
* Who wasn’t happy after Jesus healed the man’s body and his heart?
