# Water into Wine
*11/7/2021*


*Did Jesus have fun?*


* John 1 ends with Jesus recruiting more disciples - John 2 transitions into this story at a wedding:
* Read [John 2:1-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+2%3A1-12&version=NLT)


## Side Notes:
* Six stone water jars, holding up to thirty gallons each. That would be somewhere close to 180 gallons (John makes the point of saying that the jars were filled “to the brim”). One hundred eighty gallons equals about 682 liters. That would be 908 bottles of wine.
* Verse 12 - "After the wedding he went to Capernaum" - this is a distance of about 17 miles.

## Sermon from Tim Keller *A wedding party encounters Jesus* 
* [Isaiah 25:6-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+25%3A6-9&version=NLT)
* Jesus is the true master of ceremonies, the Lord of the Banquet
* Yes, there will be suffering and sacrifice, but these will be the means to an end: An eternal festival

## With the Kids
* Read John 2:1-12
* Do you think Jesus had fun?
* If he was here with us, do you think he would play with us?
* Watch "Water into Wine" (Episode 3 on Plex) from The Chosen
