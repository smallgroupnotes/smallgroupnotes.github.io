## Passage

[John 1:43-51](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A43-51&version=NLT)

## For the kids
* Read [John 1:43-51](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A43-51&version=NLT)
* Watch "I saw you (Come and See)" (Episode 7 on Plex) from The Chosen
* Jesus sees us.  He knows when we have good days and when we have bad days.  He cares about *you*.
* Nathaniel could tell just from meeting Jesus that he was God's son - because he knew the heart of God.  We can strive to have a heart of God so we can recognize him.
* In the video, Phillip was a good friend to Nathaniel when he was feeling sad. Who can you be a good friend to?  Can we watch for people that might be sad and need a friend?
