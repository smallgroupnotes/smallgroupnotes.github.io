* Sukkot (The Feast Of Tabernacles, Feast of Shelters)

The Feast of Tabernacles required sacrifices of sin offerings and burnt offerings. At the time of preparation for the morning sacrifice, a priest would descend to the Pool of Siloam—amidst great music, celebration, and singing of Isaiah 12:3—and fill a golden pitcher with water.

After dipping his pitcher in Siloam’s water, the priest would return to the Temple Mount and pour the water into one of the silver basins by the altar. “Raise your hand!” the people would shout to the priest so that they could see he indeed poured the water into the basin.

> “He who has not seen the rejoicing at the Simchat Bet Hasheavah (the water drawing ceremony), has never seen rejoicing in his life” (The Mishna, _Sukkah_ 5:1).

## For the Kids
* Read [Matthew 12:9-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+12%3A9-14&version=NLT)
* The Pharisees followed rules so closely, that they were even against healing on the Sabbath
* What animal did Jesus ask the Pharisees about?
* When Jesus healed the man on the Sabbath, what do you think he was showing people?
* This story can remind us that we can get caught up in following "church rules" and sometimes forget to show love to others.
* This story also shows that Jesus cares so much about us that he would rather take care of someone even if it means that other people would try to hurt him because of it.
* This is a good reminder to us to show love to others even if others think we are silly for doing it.
