# Matthew follows Jesus
*3/6/2022*

## Passages
* [Matthew 9:9-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+9%3A9-13&version=NLT)
* [Mark 2:14-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+2%3A14-17&version=NLT)
* [Luke 5:27-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+5%3A27-32&version=NLT)

## Notes
* There are only 7 mentions of Matthew/Levi in the Bible
* The Gospel of Matthew’s author is anonymous, but Matthew the Apostle is traditionally considered the author. The early church claimed he wrote it, and the attribution “according to Matthew” was added possibly as early as the second century. While there are credible arguments against his authorship, no alternative writer has been named.

## For the kids
* Read Matthew 9:9
* Tax collectors were hated - they were allowed to collect more taxes than was required and keep the rest of the money

### After the video

* Jesus attracted all kinds of people to him, mainly through his love
* Today, we can attract other people to Jesus by showing others the love of Jesus

### After the next video (Dinner Party)
* Read Matthew 9:10-13
* How can the people that the world calls "scum" ever learn about Jesus if everyone avoids them?
