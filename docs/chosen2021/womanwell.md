# The woman at the well
*5/15/2022*

## For the kids
* Watch the video
* Were the disciples excited to go to Samaria?
* Were women respected in those times?
* Did the other women in the city like spending time with this woman?
* This is a Samaritan woman who is looked down on by pretty much everyone in the world, and Jesus made it a point to talk to her individually, and ended up starting his ministry of preaching to large crowds through her.
* Read the end of the story: [John 4:39-42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+4%3A39-42&version=NLT)
* The people in her village believed in Jesus because of this woman's testimony

### Takeaways
* Our testimonies (telling others what Jesus did in our lives) make a difference in other people's lives
* Are there people around us that everyone looks down on?  Are there ways we can show them love like Jesus did with the woman at the well?
* God loves you. He doesn't care what you have done.  He is willing to spend time to personally reach out to you.
