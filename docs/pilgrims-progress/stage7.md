### Notes

#### Christian meets Hopeful

* Faithful's humility and meekness was a witness to Hopeful.  He still gave a defense for himself, but he did not "fight" back.

#### By-ends and his friends

* [Proverbs 26:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2026:25&version=NLT)
>   They pretend to be kind, but don’t believe them. Their hearts are full of many evils.
* The importance of having discernment from God
* By-ends held onto his religion and told Christian he could never let go of it
* By-ends and his friends thought they were going on a pilgrimige as well.
* Hold-the-world's favorite part of his religion was God's blessings
* [John 6:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206:26&version=NLT)
>   Jesus replied, “I tell you the truth, you want to be with me because I fed you, not because you understood the miraculous signs.
* Being made complete and having the hole inside our heart always filled is what draws us to God.
* [Genesis 34:20-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2034:20-24&version=NLT)
>   and he went with his father, Hamor, to present this proposal to the leaders at the town gate.  “These men are our friends,” they said. “Let’s invite them to live here among us and trade freely. Look, the land is large enough to hold them. We can take their daughters as wives and let them marry ours.  But they will consider staying here and becoming one people with us only if all of our men are circumcised, just as they are.  But if we do this, all their livestock and possessions will eventually be ours. Come, let’s agree to their terms and let them settle here among us.”  So all the men in the town council agreed with Hamor and Shechem, and every male in the town was circumcised.
* If a church's goal is to bring people in so that the church can have more (money), that is obviously the wrong desire.  The cart before the horse - instead people being drawn in by love and being made complete in God's love in turn will become generous and the church will "prosper".
* [Luke 20:46-47](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2020:46-47&version=NLT)
>   “Beware of these teachers of religious law! For they like to parade around in flowing robes and love to receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces. And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the head table at banquets.  Yet they shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public. Because of this, they will be severely punished.”
* The danger of using religion for your own benefits
* [John 12:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2012:6&version=NLT)
>   Not that he cared for the poor—he was a thief, and since he was in charge of the disciples’ money, he often stole some for himself.
* That would be hard to balance - I'd have a hard time being a pastor and taking a salary (not saying they shouldn't) - it would be difficult to work through.
* [Acts 8:19-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%208:19-22&version=NLT)
>   “Let me have this power, too,” he exclaimed, “so that when I lay my hands on people, they will receive the Holy Spirit!”  But Peter replied, “May your money be destroyed with you for thinking God’s gift can be bought!  You can have no part in this, for your heart is not right with God.  Repent of your wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive your evil thoughts,
* Thinking God's gift can be bought...
* Money-love's description of pastors and churches:
	* The draw for bigger congregations and more money to grow even more
	* He reasoned that a bigger congregation would help him be a better pastor

#### Plain of Ease

* Interesting how quickly they passed through the Plain of Ease - if our time in the Plain of Ease was long, how faithful would we be to God?

#### Lucre-hill, Demas, and the Silver Mine
* Lucre: Money, especially when regarded as distasteful or gained in a dishonorable way.
* [1 Timothy 6:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%206:9&version=NLT)
>   But people who long to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction.
* Interesting how Christian had learned from his previous mistakes of being led astray while Hopeful was willing to look.
* [2 Timothy 4:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%204:10&version=NLT)
>   Demas has deserted me because he loves the things of this life and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus has gone to Dalmatia.
* Demas was one of Paul's fellow-workers who abandoned him in his time of need.
* [Matthew 27:3-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027:3-5&version=NLT)
>   When Judas, who had betrayed him, realized that Jesus had been condemned to die, he was filled with remorse. So he took the thirty pieces of silver back to the leading priests and the elders.  “I have sinned,” he declared, “for I have betrayed an innocent man.” “What do we care?” they retorted. “That’s your problem.”  Then Judas threw the silver coins down in the Temple and went out and hanged himself.
* The draw of the world and its weath brought Judas to his destruction
* Important to remember where are treasure really is and what really matters
* [Genesis 19:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2019:26&version=NLT)
>   But Lot’s wife looked back as she was following behind him, and she turned into a pillar of salt.
* A good reminder of the draw of the world and the pull to sin.  
* [Numbers 16:31-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2016:31-32&version=NLT)
>   He had hardly finished speaking the words when the ground suddenly split open beneath them.  The earth opened its mouth and swallowed the men, along with their households and all their followers who were standing with them, and everything they owned.
* Also good to remember that sin has consequences (not necessarily direct punishment from God but natural consequences)
* [Genesis 13:10-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2013:10-13&version=NLT)
>   Lot took a long look at the fertile plains of the Jordan Valley in the direction of Zoar. The whole area was well watered everywhere, like the garden of the Lord or the beautiful land of Egypt. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)  Lot chose for himself the whole Jordan Valley to the east of them. He went there with his flocks and servants and parted company with his uncle Abram.  So Abram settled in the land of Canaan, and Lot moved his tents to a place near Sodom and settled among the cities of the plain.  But the people of this area were extremely wicked and constantly sinned against the Lord.
* Lot "flirted" with the world and eventually became impacted by his decisions

#### The River of Life and Vain-Confidence
* [Revelation 22:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022:1&version=NLT)
>   Then the angel showed me a river with the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.
* The deep beauty of God's provisions.
* [Psalms 23:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2023:2&version=NLT)
>   He lets me rest in green meadows; he leads me beside peaceful streams.
* A reminder of how God provides for us and shelters us
* [Numbers 21:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2021:4&version=NLT)
>   Then the people of Israel set out from Mount Hor, taking the road to the Red Sea to go around the land of Edom. But the people grew impatient with the long journey,
* And a reminder of how quickly we can forget God's provisions
* [Proverbs 28:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2028:26&version=NLT)
>   Those who trust their own insight are foolish, but anyone who walks in wisdom is safe.
* Vain-Confidence wasn't purposely trying to mislead them - but it shows the importance of testing what we hear against the Bible.
* [Jeremiah 31:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2031:21&version=NLT)
>   Set up road signs; put up guideposts. Mark well the path by which you came. Come back again, my virgin Israel; return to your towns here.
* The importance of teaching others, but also paying attention to what we have been taught.

#### Doubting Castle and Giant Despair
* Diffidence: The opposite of confidence
* Christian and Hopeful tried "with all the skill they had" to return to the Way but were instead overcome by doubt and despair
	* The despair of wandering astray yet one more time - and bringing a brother with him
* [Psalms 88:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2088:18&version=NLT)
>   You have taken away my companions and loved ones. Darkness is my closest friend.
* The result of taking their eyes away from Jesus
* Christian and Hopeful ended up in Doubting Castle because they were no longer looking to Christ and resting in His provision. They had looked to themselves to find an easier path. And even when they realized their error and sought to return to the Way, they failed, striving in their own efforts. "All the skill they had" was not sufficient to revive and restore them.
* [Job 7:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%207:15&version=NLT)
>   I would rather be strangled— rather die than suffer like this.
* Utter despair
* Despair beats us without mercy and leaves us feeling utterly hopeless.
* Despair goes hand-in-hand with doubt - It causes us to question what we know to be true. It isolates us and casts suspicion over hope/joy.
* But then Hopeful reminds us of who God is and what God has said - he was working to set their eyes back on Jesus.
	* The blessing of having friends to strengthen us in times of despair
* Just when you think it might get better Giant Despair comes back and tells them they are going to wish they were never born
	* Hopefull reminds Christian God protecting him from Apollyon
* Yet again, things seem better but Despair shows them all of the other pilgrims he has destroyed
	* Despair is relentless
* Important to remember Romans 5:3–5 "*And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope. Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us*"
* Very interesting how strong Despair was in the dark but weak in the light

#### The Key of Promise
* Led me to [2 Peter 1:2–4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A2%E2%80%934&version=NLT):
> May God give you more and more grace and peace as you grow in your knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord.
> By his divine power, God has given us everything we need for living a godly life. We have received all of this by coming to know him, the one who called us to himself by means of his marvelous glory and excellence.
> And because of his glory and excellence, he has given us great and precious promises. These are the promises that enable you to share his divine nature and escape the world’s corruption caused by human desires.

* *Escape the world's corruption* - The Key of God's Promises help us escape the world!
* Despair and doubt caused him to forget God's promises
* When doubt enters and Jesus is not in our view, we can have the hardest time believing that someone like us can be saved. Even when we take hold of the Key, the Lock can be stubborn - but the promise of the gospel will indeed open it.
* Also reminded me of when Christian saw the man in the cage at Interpreters house - he was imprisoned because he could not imagine being free

* In the end, it was God's promises that freed them from doubt and despair.
	* Our friends cannot free us (although they can remind us of God's promises)
	* Searching for a way of escape is trying to do it on our own strength (although in the searching we could discover God's promises that we forgot)
