### Notes

#### Loses his burden at the Cross
* https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/at-what-point-in-pilgrims-progress-does-christian-get-saved/
	* The burden represents psychological guilt not forensic guilt.
	* In other words, he was saved when he passed the wicket gate, but he was free of his psychological guilt at the cross
* [Isaiah 26:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2026:1&version=NLT)
>   In that day, everyone in the land of Judah will sing this song: Our city is strong! We are surrounded by the walls of God’s salvation.
* Surrounded by the walls of God's salvation - that is a great way to think about the walls of heaven!
* [Zechariah 12:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah%2012:10&version=NLT)
>   “Then I will pour out a spirit of grace and prayer on the family of David and on the people of Jerusalem. They will look on me whom they have pierced and mourn for him as for an only son. They will grieve bitterly for him as for a firstborn son who has died.
* Is the "him" speaking of Jesus?
* I love the "pour out a spirit of grace and prayer"
* [Isaiah 53:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053:5&version=NLT)
>   But he was pierced for our rebellion, crushed for our sins. He was beaten so we could be whole. He was whipped so we could be healed.
* Beaten so we could be whole.  Whipped so we could be healed.  I love the NLT translation here.
	* The Message translation here is very powerful.  "All the things wrong with *us*"
* [Zechariah 3:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah%203:4&version=NLT)
>   So the angel said to the others standing there, “Take off his filthy clothes.” And turning to Jeshua he said, “See, I have taken away your sins, and now I am giving you these fine new clothes.”
* Such an important reminder.  I think it's easy to view ourselves dirty but still redeemed.  We need to remember that we are no longer dirty!
* [Ephesians 1:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:13&version=NLT)
>   And now you Gentiles have also heard the truth, the Good News that God saves you. And when you believed in Christ, he identified you as his own by giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long ago.
* "He identified you as his own"
* "Gave you the Holy Spirit"
* **Notes on the scroll**
	* From [this page](http://taste-that-which-is-good.blogspot.com/2009/10/pilgrims-progress-what-is-roll.html)
> This morning I asked my girls, "What is the scroll?" 11 yr old bubbled over with the following explanation. She talked fast, I tried to write it down word for word. I asked her to repeat it again a few times and so to the best of my ability below is what she said. Read it fast, excitedly and with a happy ring to it and you will recapture our conversation this morning.

> "The scroll is the call of God in your life, as you sense that and look at that then the wonders of God's word are opened up to you, and they amaze you and excite you, and make you so happy that you run faster for heaven. And each time you look into that call of God in your life his word is speaking to you, and you are being thrilled so that you should do this often for refreshment. But if you are lazy, slothful, and sinning you can lose that sense of the call of God in your life. It becomes dull to you, you look and it's not there because of sin. So you need to go back in your thoughts to the place where you lost it and through all that laziness and sloth and sin, repenting of it, sorry for it and find again God's call in your life. And once more have the wonders of God's word opened up to you and making you happy and excited so that you run fast for heaven again."
  * See [Ephesians 4:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4%3A30&version=NLT)
  > And do not bring sorrow to God’s Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he has identified you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption.
#### Simple, Sloth, Presumption, Formalist, Hypocrisy
* [Proverbs 23:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2023:34&version=NLT)
>   You will stagger like a sailor tossed at sea, clinging to a swaying mast.
* Skimmed over this at first but the more I thought about it the more it made sense.  How hopeless and pointless it is to be complacent about our faith!
* [1 Peter 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%205:8&version=NLT)
>   Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.
* If the devil was literally a lion chasing us, how much more fervent would we be in following Jesus?  I could argue that the reality is even more important...
* [John 10:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:1&version=NLT)
>   “I tell you the truth, anyone who sneaks over the wall of a sheepfold, rather than going through the gate, must surely be a thief and a robber!
* I suppose this is more like talking the talk and not walking the walk?  The analogy is a little weird though because they (formality and hypocrisy) are walking on the narrow path - but I guess I would say they are just going through the motions.
* [Galatians 2:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202:16&version=NLT)
>   Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law.”
* So counterintuitive sometimes - but it is so compelling to want to follow rules to be right - but "no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law"

#### Hill of Difficulty
* [Isaiah 49:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2049:10&version=NLT)
>   They will neither hunger nor thirst. The searing sun will not reach them anymore. For the Lord in his mercy will lead them; he will lead them beside cool waters.
* This is hard to remember or picture, but I guess is it comforting to remember.
* [Proverbs 6:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%206:6&version=NLT)
>   Take a lesson from the ants, you lazybones. Learn from their ways and become wise!
* 

#### Sleep in the Daytime

#### Timorous and Mistrust

#### Misses his scroll
* [1 Thessalonians 5:6-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%205:6-8&version=NLT)
>   So be on your guard, not asleep like the others. Stay alert and be clearheaded.  Night is the time when people sleep and drinkers get drunk.  But let us who live in the light be clearheaded, protected by the armor of faith and love, and wearing as our helmet the confidence of our salvation.
* Christian compared it to Israel wandering in the desert
* What a waste of time to be lazy
#### The palace Beautiful

#### The lions
* [Mark 4:40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204:40&version=NLT)
>   Then he asked them, “Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?”
* So many circumstances where it feels like our world is falling a part.  We can't see the lions chains so we assume we will be destroyed.  When a circumstance seems so impossible it feels like nothing can save it, but having faith that God can work it out for good should give us courage to go on.
	* Having faith when people I love get divorced...
#### Talk with Discretion, Piety, Prudence, and Charity
* [Genesis 9:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%209:27&version=NLT)
>   May God expand the territory of Japheth! May Japheth share the prosperity of Shem, and may Canaan be his servant.”
* 
* [Hebrews 11:15-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011:15-16&version=NLT)
>   If they had longed for the country they came from, they could have gone back.  But they were looking for a better place, a heavenly homeland. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
* Do you ever think about "going back"?  To just throw everything away and live your own life?
	* The people I have seen do this always look so sad and lonely
* [Romans 7:15, 21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207:15,%2021&version=NLT)
>   I don’t really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don’t do it. Instead, I do what I hate.
* Classic.  Why do we do the things we know we shouldn't?  You would think we'd be able to stop...
	* The book says to meditate on the cross
* [Revelation 21:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:4&version=NLT)
>   He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain. All these things are gone forever.”
* **forever** - we need to remember that.
* [Genesis 19:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2019:14&version=NLT)
>   So Lot rushed out to tell his daughters’ fiancés, “Quick, get out of the city! The Lord is about to destroy it.” But the young men thought he was only joking.
* In the end, you cannot force your loved ones to follow Jesus - they have to decide.
* [1 John 3:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:12&version=NLT)
>   We must not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because Cain had been doing what was evil, and his brother had been doing what was righteous.
* 
* [Ezekiel 3:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%203:19&version=NLT)
>   If you warn them and they refuse to repent and keep on sinning, they will die in their sins. But you will have saved yourself because you obeyed me.
* In the end we need to make sure we are living pure lives before Jesus.  Being consumed by someone who won't decide to follow Jesus will drag you down.

#### About the Lord of the Hill
* [Hebrews 2:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%202:14-15&version=NLT)
>   Because God’s children are human beings—made of flesh and blood—the Son also became flesh and blood. For only as a human being could he die, and only by dying could he break the power of the devil, who had the power of death.  Only in this way could he set free all who have lived their lives as slaves to the fear of dying.
* This makes us love him even more!
* [1 Samuel 2:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%202:8&version=NLT)
>   He lifts the poor from the dust and the needy from the garbage dump. He sets them among princes, placing them in seats of honor. For all the earth is the Lord’s, and he has set the world in order.
* 
#### Wonders shown to Christian
* [Hebrews 11:33-34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011:33-34&version=NLT)
>   By faith these people overthrew kingdoms, ruled with justice, and received what God had promised them. They shut the mouths of lions,  quenched the flames of fire, and escaped death by the edge of the sword. Their weakness was turned to strength. They became strong in battle and put whole armies to flight.
* What a strong background of our faith - this should bring encouragement to us!  The great cloud of witnesses that went before us.
* [Isaiah 33:16-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2033:16-17&version=NLT)
>   these are the ones who will dwell on high. The rocks of the mountains will be their fortress. Food will be supplied to them, and they will have water in abundance.  Your eyes will see the king in all his splendor, and you will see a land that stretches into the distance.
* Keep our eyes fixed on heaven - that should give encouragement to press on.
