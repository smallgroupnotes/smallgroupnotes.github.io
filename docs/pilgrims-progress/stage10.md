# Pilgrim's Progress
## Stage 10

#### Talk of Christian and Hopeful (Temporary and the backslider)

* [Proverbs 1:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%201:7&version=NLT)
>   Fear of the Lord is the foundation of true knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.
* I think it starts with taking God seriously. Your foundation is established when you start taking your relationship with God serisiously.
* [2 Peter 2:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%202:22&version=NLT)
>   They prove the truth of this proverb: “A dog returns to its vomit.” And another says, “A washed pig returns to the mud.”
* People who are only following Jesus because they are afraid of hell will keep returning to their sins
* [Proverbs 29:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2029:25&version=NLT)
>   Fearing people is a dangerous trap, but trusting the Lord means safety.
*  Following the Lord's instructions really are the only way to navigate life

#### The land of Beulah and the shining ones
* [Isaiah 62:4-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2062:4-12&version=NLT)
>   Never again will you be called “The Forsaken City” or “The Desolate Land.” Your new name will be “The City of God’s Delight” and “The Bride of God,” for the Lord delights in you and will claim you as his bride.  Your children will commit themselves to you, O Jerusalem, just as a young man commits himself to his bride. Then God will rejoice over you as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride.  O Jerusalem, I have posted watchmen on your walls; they will pray day and night, continually. Take no rest, all you who pray to the Lord.  Give the Lord no rest until he completes his work, until he makes Jerusalem the pride of the earth.  The Lord has sworn to Jerusalem by his own strength: “I will never again hand you over to your enemies. Never again will foreign warriors come and take away your grain and new wine.  You raised the grain, and you will eat it, praising the Lord. Within the courtyards of the Temple, you yourselves will drink the wine you have pressed.”  Go out through the gates! Prepare the highway for my people to return! Smooth out the road; pull out the boulders; raise a flag for all the nations to see.  The Lord has sent this message to every land: “Tell the people of Israel, ‘Look, your Savior is coming. See, he brings his reward with him as he comes.’”  They will be called “The Holy People” and “The People Redeemed by the Lord.” And Jerusalem will be known as “The Desirable Place” and “The City No Longer Forsaken.”
* To go through what Christian went through and finally come to God's lands - this verse describes what it must have felt like to him.  To feel so safe and secure knowing that God delights in him.
* "They couldn't even see doubting castle" - the awful times in our lives will fade away as we near the presence of Jesus.
* [1 Corinthians 10:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2010:31&version=NLT)
>   So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.
* The closer you get to God, the more focused any of our activies will be (and should be) on him.
* [Song of Solomon 7:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Song%20of%20Solomon%207:9&version=NLT)
>   May your kisses be as exciting as the best wine— Yes, wine that goes down smoothly for my lover, flowing gently over lips and teeth.
>   OR KJV: And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
* The closer we grow to God the more he is on our mind.  I think also the lines of the spiritual and earthly realms start to blur in sleep and dreams.
* [Revelation 21:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:18&version=NLT)
>   The wall was made of jasper, and the city was pure gold, as clear as glass.
* beautiful!
* [1 Corinthians 13:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2013:12&version=NLT)
>   Now we see things imperfectly, like puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we will see everything with perfect clarity. All that I know now is partial and incomplete, but then I will know everything completely, just as God now knows me completely.
* Right now we just can't undertand or even fathom all of the aspects of our relationship with God - but there will be a day when it will be made clear!

#### Christian and Hopeful pass the River

* [Psalms 73:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2073:4-5&version=NLT)
>   They seem to live such painless lives; their bodies are so healthy and strong.  They don’t have troubles like other people; they’re not plagued with problems like everyone else.
* and also maybe the things that bother other people just don't matter as much to those who walk hand-in-hand with God?
* [Isaiah 43:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2043:2&version=NLT)
>   When you go through deep waters, I will be with you. When you go through rivers of difficulty, you will not drown. When you walk through the fire of oppression, you will not be burned up; the flames will not consume you.
* If God was with you every step of your life surely he will be there when we move on to the next.

#### Welcome to the Celestial city

* [Hebrews 12:22-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012:22-24&version=NLT)
>   No, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to countless thousands of angels in a joyful gathering.  You have come to the assembly of God’s firstborn children, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God himself, who is the judge over all things. You have come to the spirits of the righteous ones in heaven who have now been made perfect.  You have come to Jesus, the one who mediates the new covenant between God and people, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks of forgiveness instead of crying out for vengeance like the blood of Abel.
* You have come to God himself - *that* is heaven!
* [Revelation 2:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%202:7&version=NLT)
>   “Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches. To everyone who is victorious I will give fruit from the tree of life in the paradise of God.
* We are already victorious!
* [Revelation 21:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:4&version=NLT)
>   He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain. All these things are gone forever.”
* How I long for this
* [Galatians 6:7-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%206:7-8&version=NLT)
>   Don’t be misled—you cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant.  Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that sinful nature. But those who live to please the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit.
* The importance of cultivating our faith on this earth
* [1 John 3:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:2&version=NLT)
>   Dear friends, we are already God’s children, but he has not yet shown us what we will be like when Christ appears. But we do know that we will be like him, for we will see him as he really is.
* Implies that we cannot see him as he really is right now.
* [1 Corinthians 6:2-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:2-3&version=NLT)
>   Don’t you realize that someday we believers will judge the world? And since you are going to judge the world, can’t you decide even these little things among yourselves?  Don’t you realize that we will judge angels? So you should surely be able to resolve ordinary disputes in this life.
* Interesting verse.  The Corinthians were taking each other to court and Paul was shaking his head at them and wrote this verse. I don't think he is saying this as a thing to look forward to - just a fact that all will be judged.  We don't really know what that judging will look like though.
* [Revelation 19:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2019:9&version=NLT)
>   And the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb.” And he added, “These are true words that come from God.”
* What a blessing!
* [Isaiah 26:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2026:2&version=NLT)
>   Open the gates to all who are righteous; allow the faithful to enter.
* The gates are open!
