### Notes

#### The Gate

* [Matthew 7:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207:7&version=NLT)
>   “Keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.
	* **Keep on** - I think it shows that it is more than just a whim - you really need to want it.  Christian was nearly desparate.

#### Conversation with Good-Will

* From the book: "An open door is set before you and no man can shut it" - you are the only one who can stop yourself from entering.  It also makes me think that once you are through the door, you cannot be forced back out.
* From the book: How sad Pliable didn't consider the few risks worth finding the celestial glory to come
* [John 6:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206:37&version=NLT)
>   However, those the Father has given me will come to me, and I will never reject them.
	* No matter what they have done!
* [Matthew 7:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207:14&version=NLT)
>   But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it.
	* Christian was surprised that it was straight.  In some ways it is surprising that we have such a hard time following a straight path.

#### The Interpreter's House

#### Christian entertained
* [1 Corinthians 4:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%204:15&version=NLT)
>   For even if you had ten thousand others to teach you about Christ, you have only one spiritual father. For I became your father in Christ Jesus when I preached the Good News to you.
	* How intimate our relationship with Jesus is!
* [Galatians 4:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%204:19&version=NLT)
>   Oh, my dear children! I feel as if I’m going through labor pains for you again, and they will continue until Christ is fully developed in your lives.
	* I've heard this verse before but never connected the pains Jesus feels for us until "seeing" it in Pilgrim's Progress

#### The Dusty Parlor (My favorite)
* [Romans 7:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207:9&version=NLT)
>   At one time I lived without understanding the law. But when I learned the command not to covet, for instance, the power of sin came to life,
	* The law chokes, the gospel frees
* [1 Corinthians 15:56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:56&version=NLT)
>   For sin is the sting that results in death, and the law gives sin its power.
	* Wow - the *law* gives sin its power!
* [Romans 5:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:20&version=NLT)
>   God’s law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were. But as people sinned more and more, God’s wonderful grace became more abundant.
	* What a beautiful verse - to be set free from rules!
* [Romans 16:25-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2016:25-26&version=NLT)
>   Now all glory to God, who is able to make you strong, just as my Good News says. This message about Jesus Christ has revealed his plan for you Gentiles, a plan kept secret from the beginning of time.  But now as the prophets foretold and as the eternal God has commanded, this message is made known to all Gentiles everywhere, so that they too might believe and obey him.
	* Once you are free from the law, God can begin to do work

#### Passion and Patience

* [Luke 16:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2016:25&version=NLT)
>   “But Abraham said to him, ‘Son, remember that during your lifetime you had everything you wanted, and Lazarus had nothing. So now he is here being comforted, and you are in anguish.
	* A reminder to focus on things that last
* [2 Corinthians 4:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204:18&version=NLT)
>   So we don’t look at the troubles we can see now; rather, we fix our gaze on things that cannot be seen. For the things we see now will soon be gone, but the things we cannot see will last forever.
	* Another reminder - the things we cannot see will last forever, but the things we see now will soon be gone.

#### The Fire of Grace
* [2 Corinthians 12:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2012:9&version=NLT)
>   Each time he said, “My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.” So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me.
	* I love the analogy of Jesus stoking the fire (grace) with his love, and the devil can never put it out - he can't even see Jesus stoking it

#### The Palace of the Kingdom
* [Acts 14:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2014:22&version=NLT)
>   where they strengthened the believers. They encouraged them to continue in the faith, reminding them that we must suffer many hardships to enter the Kingdom of God.
	* A reminder that there will be hard times, but it is worth it. (Those inside cried out with a joyous voice)

#### The Backslider
* [Luke 8:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%208:13&version=NLT)
>   The seeds on the rocky soil represent those who hear the message and receive it with joy. But since they don’t have deep roots, they believe for a while, then they fall away when they face temptation.
	* The importance of having roots
* [Hebrews 6:4-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%206:4-6&version=NLT)
>   For it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened—those who have experienced the good things of heaven and shared in the Holy Spirit,  who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the power of the age to come—  and who then turn away from God. It is impossible to bring such people back to repentance; by rejecting the Son of God, they themselves are nailing him to the cross once again and holding him up to public shame.
	* It sounds so brutal, but upon thinking about it, how *would* you convince someone who has tasted the goodness and walked away to come back to God?
* [Luke 19:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2019:14&version=NLT)
>   But his people hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We do not want him to be our king.’
	* 
* [Hebrews 10:29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010:29&version=NLT)
>   Just think how much worse the punishment will be for those who have trampled on the Son of God, and have treated the blood of the covenant, which made us holy, as if it were common and unholy, and have insulted and disdained the Holy Spirit who brings God’s mercy to us.
	* Yikes...


#### The Dream of Judgment

* [John 5:28-29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205:28-29&version=NLT)
>   Don’t be so surprised! Indeed, the time is coming when all the dead in their graves will hear the voice of God’s Son,  and they will rise again. Those who have done good will rise to experience eternal life, and those who have continued in evil will rise to experience judgment.
	* The urgency to remember the Day of Judegement
* [Malachi 4:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi%204:1&version=NLT)
>   The Lord of Heaven’s Armies says, “The day of judgment is coming, burning like a furnace. On that day the arrogant and the wicked will be burned up like straw. They will be consumed—roots, branches, and all.
	* The Day of Judgement is a filter - the empty deeds that we pursued in our lives will be burned up.  I don't think this is saying that this is where *people* will be burned up, but instead where anything in our lives that doesn't align with God will be burned.
* [Luke 3:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%203:17&version=NLT)
>   He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire.”
	* Same notes as previous verse
* [1 Thessalonians 4:16-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%204:16-17&version=NLT)
>   For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God. First, the believers who have died will rise from their graves.  Then, together with them, we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Then we will be with the Lord forever.
	* **Forever**
* [Romans 2:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%202:14-15&version=NLT)
>   Even Gentiles, who do not have God’s written law, show that they know his law when they instinctively obey it, even without having heard it.  They demonstrate that God’s law is written in their hearts, for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right.
	* Everyone knows in their hearts.
