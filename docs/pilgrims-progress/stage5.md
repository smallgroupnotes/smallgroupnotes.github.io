## Stage 5

### Notes

#### Talking with Faithful
* Pride goes before a fall :)

**Pliable**

* [Jeremiah 29:18-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2029:18-19&version=NLT)
>   Yes, I will pursue them with war, famine, and disease, and I will scatter them around the world. In every nation where I send them, I will make them an object of damnation, horror, contempt, and mockery.  For they refuse to listen to me, though I have spoken to them repeatedly through the prophets I sent. And you who are in exile have not listened either,” says the Lord.
* Really struck by the seriousness of this, especially given the fact that Israel abandoned God more than once!
* [2 Peter 2:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%202:22&version=NLT)
>   They prove the truth of this proverb: “A dog returns to its vomit.” And another says, “A washed pig returns to the mud.”
* Someone who returns to the mud probably hasn't really experienced God
**Wanton Woman**
* [Genesis 39:11-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2039:11-13&version=NLT)
>   One day, however, no one else was around when he went in to do his work.  She came and grabbed him by his cloak, demanding, “Come on, sleep with me!” Joseph tore himself away, but he left his cloak in her hand as he ran from the house.  When she saw that she was holding his cloak and he had fled,
* 
* [Proverbs 22:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2022:14&version=NLT)
>   The mouth of an immoral woman is a dangerous trap; those who make the Lord angry will fall into it.
* 
* [Proverbs 5:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%205:5&version=NLT)
>   Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave.
* 
* [Job 31:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2031:1&version=NLT)
>   “I made a covenant with my eyes not to look with lust at a young woman.
* 
**Adam the First**
* [Ephesians 4:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:22&version=NLT)
>   throw off your old sinful nature and your former way of life, which is corrupted by lust and deception.
* Adam the First = our struggle with our old nature.
* [1 John 2:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202:16&version=NLT)
>   For the world offers only a craving for physical pleasure, a craving for everything we see, and pride in our achievements and possessions. These are not from the Father, but are from this world.
* Even though Jesus saved us from the wages of sin, we still feel its presence.
* [Romans 7:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207:24&version=NLT)
>   Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death?
* What often makes sin so difficult to recognize and resist is that it wells up from within us.

**Moses (the law)**
* The law can teach us what is right and good, but it has no power to help us do what is right and good. The law can show us where we fail and fall short, but the law has no power to forgive or cleanse our sin. The Law can only judge and condemn us. It knocks us down and leaves us bruised and battered.

**Shame**
* Shame has no shame for himself - he shames others
* [Philippians 3:7-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%203:7-9&version=NLT)
>   I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done.  Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have discarded everything else, counting it all as garbage, so that I could gain Christ  and become one with him. I no longer count on my own righteousness through obeying the law; rather, I become righteous through faith in Christ. For God’s way of making us right with himself depends on faith.
* This frees us from shame
* [Luke 16:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2016:15&version=NLT)
>   Then he said to them, “You like to appear righteous in public, but God knows your hearts. What this world honors is detestable in the sight of God.
* Counter cultural - shame tries to keep us conformed to the world
* [Mark 8:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%208:38&version=NLT)
>   If anyone is ashamed of me and my message in these adulterous and sinful days, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”
* 
* [Proverbs 3:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%203:35&version=NLT)
>   The wise inherit honor, but fools are put to shame!

**Valley of the shadow of death**
* What a great reminder that not everyone goes through the same valleys that we do or at least not at the same time as us.

* Interesting how Faithful and Christian had different trials and experiences

#### Talkative

* [Matthew 23:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2023:3&version=NLT)
>   So practice and obey whatever they tell you, but don’t follow their example. For they don’t practice what they teach.
* "Walk your talk"
* [1 Corinthians 4:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%204:20&version=NLT)
>   For the Kingdom of God is not just a lot of talk; it is living by God’s power.
* 
* [Psalms 28:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2028:3&version=NLT)
>   Do not drag me away with the wicked— with those who do evil— those who speak friendly words to their neighbors while planning evil in their hearts.
* 
* [James 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:27&version=NLT)
>   Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you.
* Hearing and saying isn't what makes up a good christian
* [Matthew 13:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:23&version=NLT)
>   The seed that fell on good soil represents those who truly hear and understand God’s word and produce a harvest of thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!”
* 
* [Matthew 13:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:30&version=NLT)
>   Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the harvesters to sort out the weeds, tie them into bundles, and burn them, and to put the wheat in the barn.’”
* 
* [Deuteronomy 14:7-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2014:7-10&version=NLT)
>   but if the animal doesn’t have both, it may not be eaten. So you may not eat the camel, the hare, or the hyrax. They chew the cud but do not have split hooves, so they are ceremonially unclean for you.  And you may not eat the pig. It has split hooves but does not chew the cud, so it is ceremonially unclean for you. You may not eat the meat of these animals or even touch their carcasses.  “Of all the marine animals, you may eat whatever has both fins and scales.  You may not, however, eat marine animals that do not have both fins and scales. They are ceremonially unclean for you.
* 
* [1 Corinthians 13:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2013:1&version=NLT)
>   If I could speak all the languages of earth and of angels, but didn’t love others, I would only be a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
* 
* [1 Corinthians 14:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:7&version=NLT)
>   Even lifeless instruments like the flute or the harp must play the notes clearly, or no one will recognize the melody.
* 
* [Genesis 39:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2039:15&version=NLT)
>   When he heard me scream, he ran outside and got away, but he left his cloak behind with me.”
*
* [1 Corinthians 13:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2013:2&version=NLT)
>   If I had the gift of prophecy, and if I understood all of God’s secret plans and possessed all knowledge, and if I had such faith that I could move mountains, but didn’t love others, I would be nothing.
* 
* [Psalms 119:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%20119:34&version=NLT)
