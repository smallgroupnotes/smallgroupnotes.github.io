# Pilgrim's Progress

## Stage 9

### Notes

#### Christian and Hopeful meet Ignorance

* Ignorance thinks he can get in by good behavior
* [Proverbs 26:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2026:12&version=NLT)
>   There is more hope for fools than for people who think they are wise.
* The danger of thinking you know everything - rather than being willing to admit you don't know everything
* [Ecclesiastes 10:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%2010:3&version=NLT)
>   You can identify fools just by the way they walk down the street!
* It is pretty easy to identify someone who doesn't live a wise life

#### Turn-away
* [Matthew 12:45](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012:45&version=NLT)
>   “When an evil spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, seeking rest but finding none. 44 Then it says, ‘I will return to the person I came from.’ So it returns and finds its former home empty, swept, and in order. 45 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before. That will be the experience of this evil generation.”
* Turn-away represents those who have fallen away from the faith. Though they once professed to be followers of Christ, now they have turned away. They grow careless and trifle with sin to the point where it no longer disturbs them. The grow comfortable with the world. They fail to fear God and are unaffected and unrestrained by His Word. They forsake Christ only to be ensnared in sin.
	* [Hebrews 6:4-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+6%3A4%E2%80%936&version=NLT)
	> For it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened—those who have experienced the good things of heaven and shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the power of the age to come — and who then turn away from God. It is impossible to bring such people back to repentance; by rejecting the Son of God, they themselves are nailing him to the cross once again and holding him up to public shame.
  * Hebrews makes it clear in verse 6 why it is impossible for those who reject the cross to be renewed to repentance. If the cross was indeed not sufficient for them; they would need Jesus to die again.


#### Little-Faith
* Little-faith represents those who are weak in faith and spiritually unprepared to face the trials and temptations of this world. He follows Christ, but lacks courage, confidence and comfort. 
* [1 Peter 4:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%204:18&version=NLT)
>   And also, “If the righteous are barely saved, what will happen to godless sinners?”
* 
* [2 Peter 2:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%202:9&version=NLT)
>   So you see, the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their trials, even while keeping the wicked under punishment until the day of final judgment.
* 
* [Genesis 25:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2025:34&version=NLT)
>   Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew. Esau ate the meal, then got up and left. He showed contempt for his rights as the firstborn.
* 
* [Genesis 25:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2025:32&version=NLT)
>   “Look, I’m dying of starvation!” said Esau. “What good is my birthright to me now?”
* 
* [Jeremiah 2:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%202:24&version=NLT)
>   You are like a wild donkey, sniffing the wind at mating time. Who can restrain her lust? Those who desire her don’t need to search, for she goes running to them!
* The power of temptation - we seek out our sin
* [1 Peter 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%205:8&version=NLT)
>   Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.
* The importance of being on guard against sin and temptation
* [Psalms 88:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2088:1-3&version=NLT)
>   O Lord, God of my salvation, I cry out to you by day. I come to you at night.  Now hear my prayer; listen to my cry.  For my life is full of troubles, and death draws near.
* 
* [Job 41:26-29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2041:26-29&version=NLT)
>   No sword can stop it, no spear, dart, or javelin.  Iron is nothing but straw to that creature, and bronze is like rotten wood.  Arrows cannot make it flee. Stones shot from a sling are like bits of grass.  Clubs are like a blade of grass, and it laughs at the swish of javelins.
* 
* [Job 39:19-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2039:19-25&version=NLT)
>   “Have you given the horse its strength or clothed its neck with a flowing mane?  Did you give it the ability to leap like a locust? Its majestic snorting is terrifying!  It paws the earth and rejoices in its strength when it charges out to battle.  It laughs at fear and is unafraid. It does not run from the sword.  The arrows rattle against it, and the spear and javelin flash.  It paws the ground fiercely and rushes forward into battle when the ram’s horn blows.  It snorts at the sound of the horn. It senses the battle in the distance. It quivers at the captain’s commands and the noise of battle.
* 
* [Ephesians 6:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:16&version=NLT)
>   In addition to all of these, hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery arrows of the devil.
* 
* [Exodus 33:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2033:15&version=NLT)
>   Then Moses said, “If you don’t personally go with us, don’t make us leave this place.
* 
* [Psalms 3:5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%203:5-6&version=NLT)
>   I lay down and slept, yet I woke up in safety, for the Lord was watching over me.  I am not afraid of ten thousand enemies who surround me on every side.
* 
* [Isaiah 10:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2010:4&version=NLT)
>   You will stumble along as prisoners or lie among the dead. But even then the Lord’s anger will not be satisfied. His fist is still poised to strike.
* 

#### The Flatterer and the shining one
* Flattery is deceitful and insincere. It is darkness masquerading as light. It is a lie parading itself as truth. It coaxes us to think well of ourselves. It assures us that our sins are not as bad as they really are.
* [Proverbs 29:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2029:5&version=NLT)
>   To flatter friends is to lay a trap for their feet.
* 
* [Psalms 17:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2017:4&version=NLT)
>   I have followed your commands, which keep me from following cruel and evil people.
* Follow God's word
* [2 Corinthians 11:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2011:13-14&version=NLT)
>   These people are false apostles. They are deceitful workers who disguise themselves as apostles of Christ.  But I am not surprised! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
* How crafty the devil is.  It is so important to us to be familiar with God's word and His voice.
* [Romans 16:17-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2016:17-18&version=NLT)
>   And now I make one more appeal, my dear brothers and sisters. Watch out for people who cause divisions and upset people’s faith by teaching things contrary to what you have been taught. Stay away from them.  Such people are not serving Christ our Lord; they are serving their own personal interests. By smooth talk and glowing words they deceive innocent people.
* 
* [Deuteronomy 25:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2025:2&version=NLT)
>   If the person in the wrong is sentenced to be flogged, the judge must command him to lie down and be beaten in his presence with the number of lashes appropriate to the crime.
* God's discipline is a blessing that He brings to preserve us and prevent us from being destroyed by sin.
* [Revelation 3:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%203:19&version=NLT)
>   I correct and discipline everyone I love. So be diligent and turn from your indifference.
* 

#### Atheist
* Atheist refuses to believe in God and rejects the truth of the Bible. He is walking in the opposite direction, away from Zion and the Celestial City and toward Vanity and Destruction. He no longer seeks eternal life. He no longer fears eternal judgment. In fact, he no longer believes in the reality of heaven and hell.
* [Ecclesiastes 10:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%2010:15&version=NLT)
>   Fools are so exhausted by a little work that they can’t even find their way home.
* 
* [2 Corinthians 5:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:7&version=NLT)
>   For we live by believing and not by seeing.
* 
* [Proverbs 19:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2019:27&version=NLT)
>   If you stop listening to instruction, my child, you will turn your back on knowledge.
* 
* [1 John 2:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202:21&version=NLT)
>   So I am writing to you not because you don’t know the truth but because you know the difference between truth and lies.
* 

#### Enchanted Ground
* The Enchanted Ground represents dullness brought about by spiritual complacency and fatigue.  We can settle in and grow too comfortable in our faith. Our worship loses its wonder and becomes too routine.  Also, living as a Christian in a world filled with sin is hard. Rising day after day, fighting the same old battles against sin, can be wearisome.
* [1 Thessalonians 5:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%205:6&version=NLT)
>   So be on your guard, not asleep like the others. Stay alert and be clearheaded.
* 
* [Ecclesiastes 4:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%204:9&version=NLT)
>   Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed.
* 
* [Romans 6:21-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:21-23&version=NLT)
>   And what was the result? You are now ashamed of the things you used to do, things that end in eternal doom.  But now you are free from the power of sin and have become slaves of God. Now you do those things that lead to holiness and result in eternal life.  For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.
* 
* [Ephesians 5:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:6&version=NLT)
>   Don’t be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins, for the anger of God will fall on all who disobey him.
* 
* [Isaiah 64:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2064:6&version=NLT)
>   We are all infected and impure with sin. When we display our righteous deeds, they are nothing but filthy rags. Like autumn leaves, we wither and fall, and our sins sweep us away like the wind.
* 
* [Galatians 2:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202:16&version=NLT)
>   Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law.”
* 
* [Luke 17:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2017:10&version=NLT)
>   In the same way, when you obey me you should say, ‘We are unworthy servants who have simply done our duty.’”
* 


#### Hopeful's account of his conversion with Faithful
* Each Christian has their own spiritual journey - although there may be some common aspects.  
* [Hebrews 10:12-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010:12-21&version=NLT)
>   But our High Priest offered himself to God as a single sacrifice for sins, good for all time. Then he sat down in the place of honor at God’s right hand.  There he waits until his enemies are humbled and made a footstool under his feet.  For by that one offering he forever made perfect those who are being made holy.  And the Holy Spirit also testifies that this is so. For he says,  “This is the new covenant I will make with my people on that day, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.”  Then he says, “I will never again remember their sins and lawless deeds.”  And when sins have been forgiven, there is no need to offer any more sacrifices.  And so, dear brothers and sisters, we can boldly enter heaven’s Most Holy Place because of the blood of Jesus.  By his death, Jesus opened a new and life-giving way through the curtain into the Most Holy Place.  And since we have a great High Priest who rules over God’s house,
*

* 
* [Ephesians 1:18-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:18-19&version=NLT)

This is the same mighty power

* 

#### Christian and Ignorance
* Ignorance thinks about God and heaven, but even the demons believe
* Ignorance has wrongly judged his heart to be good. He is not convinced of the depth of his sin or his need of a Savior. He finds comfort in himself—his good works, his positive outlook, his self-determination.
