	* Christian told him the Prince has fully pardoned him
* [Romans 6:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:23&version=NLT)
>   For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.
* 
* [Micah 7:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah%207:8&version=NLT)
>   Do not gloat over me, my enemies! For though I fall, I will rise again. Though I sit in darkness, the Lord will be my light.
* The book made this verse come alive
* [Romans 8:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:37&version=NLT)
>   No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.
* When it feels like things can't get any worse, take comfort knowing that Jesus has the victory
* [James 4:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%204:7&version=NLT)
>   So humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
* Humble: remembering that you didn't defeat the devil - Jesus did on the cross.

##### Ploys of the Devil
1. He tries to make sin look promising, prosperous and alluring.
2. He points to the apostasy and hypocrisy of others.
3. He points to the trials and hardships of following Christ.
4. He points to Christian's own failings and sin.
5. Finally he attacks Christian's motives for following Christ.

##### Resisting the Devil
1. Christian stands his ground.
2. Christian speaks most often of his King, not of himself.
3. Christian owns his sin and rests in mercy of his King.

#### Valley of the Shadow of Death
* It was necessary for Christian to go through the Valley of the Shadow of Death
* [Jeremiah 2:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%202:6&version=NLT)
>   They did not ask, ‘Where is the Lord who brought us safely out of Egypt and led us through the barren wilderness— a land of deserts and pits, a land of drought and death, where no one lives or even travels?’
* 
* [Numbers 13:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2013:32&version=NLT)
>   So they spread this bad report about the land among the Israelites: “The land we traveled through and explored will devour anyone who goes to live there. All the people we saw were huge.
* So easy to focus on the problems and be fearful - so easy to forget about Jesus in times like that.
* [Job 10:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2010:22&version=NLT)
>   It is a land as dark as midnight, a land of gloom and confusion, where even the light is dark as midnight.’”
* 
* [Psalms 44:18, 19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2044:18,%2019&version=NLT)
>   Our hearts have not deserted you. We have not strayed from your path.
* It takes courage to continue on despite of the previous verses
* [Psalms 69:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2069:14&version=NLT)
>   Rescue me from the mud; don’t let me sink any deeper! Save me from those who hate me, and pull me from these deep waters.
* 
* [Ephesians 6:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:18&version=NLT)
>   Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere.
* When you imagine the world around us as the Valley of Death, staying alert and being persistent in prayer becomes a lot more important.
* [Psalms 116:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%20116:4&version=NLT)
>   Then I called on the name of the Lord: “Please, Lord, save me!”
* This should be our first reaction

* The part where Christian thought he was thinking the evil thoughts just shows how insidious the evil one can be.

* [Psalms 23:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2023:4&version=NLT)
>   Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me. Your rod and your staff protect and comfort me.
* It's so hard in the darkest valley to remember that Jesus is close beside us sometimes.
* [Job 9:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%209:11&version=NLT)
>   “Yet when he comes near, I cannot see him. When he moves by, I do not see him go.
* A reminder that sometimes in our lives we cannot feel God's presence but he is still there.
* [Amos 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos%205:8&version=NLT)
>   It is the Lord who created the stars, the Pleiades and Orion. He turns darkness into morning and day into night. He draws up water from the oceans and pours it down as rain on the land. The Lord is his name!
* The importance of remembering our God!
* [Job 12:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2012:22&version=NLT)
>   “He uncovers mysteries hidden in darkness; he brings light to the deepest gloom.
* A great part in the book - when he looks back and sees the dangers he walked through - so relatable in our own lives when we look back at difficult times.
* [Job 29:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2029:3&version=NLT)
>   when he lit up the way before me and I walked safely through the darkness.
* 

#### Giants Pope and Pagan
> "Pope" and "Pagan" are giants living in a cave at the end of the fearsome Valley of the Shadow of Death. They are allegories of Roman Catholicism and paganism as persecutors of Protestant Christians. "Pagan" is dead, indicating the end of pagan persecution with Antiquity, and "Pope" is alive but decrepit, indicating the then-diminished power and influence of the Roman Catholic pope.
