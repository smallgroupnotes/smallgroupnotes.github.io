# Pilgrim's Progress

## Stage 8


### Notes






#### The Delectable Mountains

* These are the mountains Christian saw when he was at the palace beautiful
* The mountains are showing a time in a mature christian's life - heaven is in view, the world isn't as noticeable.
* Maybe the shepherds are like pastors or strong christian influences
* Christian is starting to learn his lesson - he checks with the shepherds to make sure he is on the right path

* [John 10:11-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:11-15&version=NLT)
>   “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd sacrifices his life for the sheep.  A hired hand will run when he sees a wolf coming. He will abandon the sheep because they don’t belong to him and he isn’t their shepherd. And so the wolf attacks them and scatters the flock.  The hired hand runs away because he’s working only for the money and doesn’t really care about the sheep.  “I am the good shepherd; I know my own sheep, and they know me,  just as my Father knows me and I know the Father. So I sacrifice my life for the sheep.
* The people who live in "God's land" know Jesus and know that he guards them
* [Hosea 14:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%2014:9&version=NLT)
>   Let those who are wise understand these things. Let those with discernment listen carefully. The paths of the Lord are true and right, and righteous people live by walking in them. But in those paths sinners stumble and fall.
* The importance of gaining wisdom, learning from your mistakes, and staying on the path Jesus planned for you.
* [Hebrews 13:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013:2&version=NLT)
>   Don’t forget to show hospitality to strangers, for some who have done this have entertained angels without realizing it!
* Reminding us of our calling to love everyone

#### The Hills of Error and Caution

* When they climb higher up the mountain they are able to see everything around them more clearly (the good and the dangerous things)
* The shepherds/pastors guide and protect their flock from error

* [2 Timothy 2:17-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:17-18&version=NLT)
>   This kind of talk spreads like cancer, as in the case of Hymenaeus and Philetus.  They have left the path of truth, claiming that the resurrection of the dead has already occurred; in this way, they have turned some people away from the faith.
* The importance of testing what we learn against the Bible.  Also a warning to not lead others astray.
* [Proverbs 21:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2021:16&version=NLT)
>   The person who strays from common sense will end up in the company of the dead.
* A grave warning that seems easy enough to follow, but in many christian's cases we stray

* The people wandering blind started out following God but wanted to find a way that was easier - that didn't require so much work.
* Being blind - I don't think is permanent.  I think they are blinded by their own despair, just like Christian was.  There is hope though: The promises of God like "if we confess our sin he is faithful to forgive us of our sin"
* Christian and Hopeful were convicted - this is like when it feels like a sermon was given directly for you.

#### A by-way to Hell

* I think this shows the danger of living in error and sin and ignoring caution - you end up destroying yourself.  
* Again, this is not permanent, because God is faithful to forgive our sin - but we do need to turn from it and confess.

#### The hill called clear

* That point in our life when we see Jesus clearly
* The perspective glass is like applying God's word - making it real in our lives - heaven and the the things of Jesus become clear
	* Maybe faith is the hands that hold the perspective glass - we can waver and what we see through it is not as clear?
* The shepherds/pastors help people see heaven more clearly
* The closer we walk with Jesus the more clear our view of heaven becomes

* This part of the journey reminds us to remember the promises found in the Bible, to take caution of being led astray, and to also remember that eternity is at stake.
