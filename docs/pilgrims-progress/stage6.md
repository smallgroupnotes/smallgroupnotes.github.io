### Notes

* [John 4:36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%204:36&version=NLT)
>   The harvesters are paid good wages, and the fruit they harvest is people brought to eternal life. What joy awaits both the planter and the harvester alike!
*
* [Galatians 6:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%206:9&version=NLT)
>   So let’s not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don’t give up.
*
* [1 Corinthians 9:24-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209:24-27&version=NLT)
>   Don’t you realize that in a race everyone runs, but only one person gets the prize? So run to win!  All athletes are disciplined in their training. They do it to win a prize that will fade away, but we do it for an eternal prize.  So I run with purpose in every step. I am not just shadowboxing.  I discipline my body like an athlete, training it to do what it should. Otherwise, I fear that after preaching to others I myself might be disqualified.
*
* [Revelation 3:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%203:11&version=NLT)
>   I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take away your crown.
*
* [1 Peter 4:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%204:19&version=NLT)
>   So if you are suffering in a manner that pleases God, keep on doing what is right, and trust your lives to the God who created you, for he will never fail you.
*
* [Psalms 62:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2062:9&version=NLT)
>   Common people are as worthless as a puff of wind, and the powerful are not what they appear to be. If you weigh them on the scales, together they are lighter than a breath of air.
*
* [Ecclesiastes 11:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%2011:8&version=NLT)
>   When people live to be very old, let them rejoice in every day of life. But let them also remember there will be many dark days. Everything still to come is meaningless.
*
* [Matthew 4:8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204:8-9&version=NLT)
>   Next the devil took him to the peak of a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.  “I will give it all to you,” he said, “if you will kneel down and worship me.”
*
* [1 Corinthians 4:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%204:9-10&version=NLT)
>   Instead, I sometimes think God has put us apostles on display, like prisoners of war at the end of a victor’s parade, condemned to die. We have become a spectacle to the entire world—to people and angels alike.  Our dedication to Christ makes us look like fools, but you claim to be so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are so powerful! You are honored, but we are ridiculed.
*
* [Psalms 119:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%20119:37&version=NLT)
>   Turn my eyes from worthless things, and give me life through your word.
*
* [Philippians 3:20-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%203:20-21&version=NLT)
>   But we are citizens of heaven, where the Lord Jesus Christ lives. And we are eagerly waiting for him to return as our Savior.  He will take our weak mortal bodies and change them into glorious bodies like his own, using the same power with which he will bring everything under his control.
*
* [Proverbs 23:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2023:23&version=NLT)
>   Get the truth and never sell it; also get wisdom, discipline, and good judgment.
*
* [Hebrews 11:14, 16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011:14,%2016&version=NLT)
>   Obviously people who say such things are looking forward to a country they can call their own.
*
* [Exodus 1:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%201:22&version=NLT)
>   Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Throw every newborn Hebrew boy into the Nile River. But you may let the girls live.”
*

* [Daniel 6:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%206:7&version=NLT)
>   We are all in agreement—we administrators, officials, high officers, advisers, and governors—that the king should make a law that will be strictly enforced. Give orders that for the next thirty days any person who prays to anyone, divine or human—except to you, Your Majesty—will be thrown into the den of lions.
