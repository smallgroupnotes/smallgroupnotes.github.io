### Notes

* [Psalm 38:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+38%3A4&version=NLT) "My guilt overwhelms me — it is a burden too heavy to bear."
* Can relate to this feeling


* [Habakkuk 1:2-3 ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Habakkuk+1%3A2-3&version=NLT)
> How long, O Lord, must I call for help?
    But you do not listen!
 “Violence is everywhere!” I cry,
    but you do not come to save.
 Must I forever see these evil deeds?
    Why must I watch all this misery?
 Wherever I look,
    I see destruction and violence.
 I am surrounded by people
    who love to argue and fight.
    
* This is very 2019 - destruction, violence, people who argue and fight

* [Hebrews 9:27-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+9%3A27&version=NLT)
> And just as each person is destined to die once and after that comes judgment, so also Christ was offered once for all time as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people. He will come again, not to deal with our sins, but to bring salvation to all who are eagerly waiting for him.

* Thank goodness for verse 28 because verse 27 would be pretty awful by itself

* [Matthew 3:7-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+3%3A7-8&version=NLT) 
> But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to watch him baptize, he denounced them. “You brood of snakes!” he exclaimed. “Who warned you to flee the coming wrath? Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God.
* The importance of living your faith (walk the walk, not just talk the talk)


* [2 Peter 1:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A19&version=NLT)
> Because of that experience, we have even greater confidence in the message proclaimed by the prophets. You must pay close attention to what they wrote, for their words are like a lamp shining in a dark place—until the Day dawns, and Christ the Morning Star shines in your hearts.
* What an amazing visual and reminder to read the Bible *and* pay attention to it

* [Luke 14:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+14%3A26&version=NLT)
> “If you want to be my disciple, you must, by comparison, hate everyone else—your father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even your own life. Otherwise, you cannot be my disciple.
* Hyperbole since Jesus told us to love everyone, even our enemies.  I think this means our allegiance to Christ is to never compete with our allegiance to anyone or anything else.

* [2 Corinthians 4:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+4%3A18&version=NLT)
> So we don’t look at the troubles we can see now; rather, we fix our gaze on things that cannot be seen. For the things we see now will soon be gone, but the things we cannot see will last forever.
* Fix our gaze on *things that cannot be seen*
* So important to remember that many of the things we "love"  will soon be gone

* [1 Peter 1:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1%3A4&version=NLT)
> and we have a priceless inheritance—an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay.
* Important to remember that the things we do here that have eternal value can never be corrupted

* [Titus 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+1%3A2&version=NLT)
> This truth gives them confidence that they have eternal life, which God—who does not lie—promised them before the world began.
* What an amazing verse to cling to

* [Isaiah 25:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+25%3A8&version=NLT)
> He will swallow up death forever!
    The Sovereign Lord will wipe away all tears.
He will remove forever all insults and mockery
    against his land and people.
    The Lord has spoken!
* This is indeed something worth leaving everything else behind

* [Revelation 21:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A6&version=NLT)
> And he also said, “It is finished! I am the Alpha and the Omega—the Beginning and the End. To all who are thirsty I will give freely from the springs of the water of life.
* *Freely* 

* [Psalm 40:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+40%3A2&version=NLT)
> He lifted me out of the pit of despair,
    out of the mud and the mire.
He set my feet on solid ground
    and steadied me as I walked along.
* The book really helped visualize this verse

* From the book, slough of despond is a place where sinners become aware of their sins - so true!

* [1 Corinthians 7:29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7%3A29&version=NLT)
> But let me say this, dear brothers and sisters: The time that remains is very short. So from now on, those with wives should not focus only on their marriage.
* A reminder to work towards things that will have everlasting value (which can include a marriage)

* Interesting: Christian said he didn't have his burden until he read the book.  I'm sure it can seem like that sometimes.

* The gulit and pain Christian experienced when Evangelism met him when he was trying to take the easy way - ouch

* [Matthew 7:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A13-14&version=NLT)
> “You can enter God’s Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way. But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it.
* The road *is* difficult
* Only a few ever find it.  I wonder if this is talking about salvation, or does it actually mean *few* in which case is the verse talking about people who become so close to Jesus that they become like him?

* [Galatians 3:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A10&version=NLT)
> But those who depend on the law to make them right with God are under his curse, for the Scriptures say, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the commands that are written in God’s Book of the Law.”
* Trying to follow a law with the intentions of being right only becomes a curse...

* From the book: "Your sin is great".  This chapter was a great reminder of the gravity of our sins.  It makes it that much more sweeter to think of what Jesus did for us on the cross.

### Some thoughts

* Other verses I am reminded of:
	* [John 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=NLT) “For this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life."
	* [Romans 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23&version=NLT) "For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God’s glorious standard."
	* [1 John 1:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A9&version=NLT) "But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness."
* God’s Word, the Bible, convicts people of their sin.
* God’s Word is the light that shows sinners to the narrow gate which is Jesus
* When we confess our sin and trust in Jesus, he forgives us and gives us life that lasts forever.
