# Prayer #1

<!-- # God Needs Prayer -->


I had a great time starting our study on prayer with you all last night!  

A quick summary is that we talked about how God wants us to pray (we've heard that before) but that He also *needs* our prayers.  

We talked about how our physical actions can affect people's lives (we can drive drunk, or choose to help someone in danger), so why wouldn't our prayers affect people as well?

We imagined a reservoir of power that God set aside, and how it is like a trust fund, where we both have to release it together.

It is a big change in thinking to imagine God *needing* anything - which we were able to discuss a lot last night.

I took some time during breakfast today to look up some verses that seem to show how prayer impacted God's decision.  In trying to keep this note shorter, I am trimming out some parts of the passages, so it might be good to look them up and read them in their full context.  

*(The translation I am using is NASB)*

## [Exodus 32:11-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+32%3A11-14&version=NASB)

> Then Moses entreated the Lord his God, and said, “O Lord, why does Your anger burn against Your people whom You have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, ‘With evil intent He brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth’? Turn from Your burning anger and change Your mind about doing harm to Your people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants to whom You swore by Yourself, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.’” So the Lord changed His mind about the harm which He said He would do to His people.

This was after Moses met with God and then came down to find the Israelites worshiping the golden calf.  God said He would destroy them, but in the passage above you can see Moses interceding on their behalf.  The last verse shows God changing his mind (in other translations it says that God relented).


## [2 Kings 20:1-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+20%3A1-6&version=NASB)

> In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, “Thus says the Lord, ‘Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.’” Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, saying, “Remember now, O Lord, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart and have done what is good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly. Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, “Return and say to Hezekiah the leader of My people, ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of your father David, “I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord. I will add fifteen years to your life, and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.”’”

Here God told Hezekiah that he would be dead soon.  Hezekiah wept, prayed, and beseeched the Lord. God then told Hezekiah that he heard his prayers and would add 15 years onto his life.


## [Exodus 17:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+17%3A11&version=NASB)
(This one is from a story that has always fascinated me)

> So it came about when Moses held his hand up, that Israel prevailed, and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed.

The Israelites were in a battle with the Amalekites.  When Moses kept his staff lifted up, the Israelites were winning, but when he let his hands come down, they would start to lose.  His arms got tired, and his brother and friend had to help him keep his hands up so that they would win the battle.

I certainly don't believe Moses was a magician or that his staff had some supernatural powers.  I believe that God helped the Israelites win as long as Moses kept his staff raised high.  

This passage doesn't mention anything about prayer, but it does show how Moses directly influenced the supernatural.  I think it is a good way to envision our prayers as well.  Imagine if we could see the results of our prayers like that!


## [Numbers 14:12-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+14%3A12-20&version=NASB)

> The Lord said to Moses, “How long will this people spurn Me? And how long will they not believe in Me, despite all the signs which I have performed in their midst? I will smite them with pestilence and dispossess them"...
> But Moses said to the Lord ... Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness, just as You also have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.” So the Lord said, “I have pardoned them according to your word."

I cut a lot out of this one because it was a big passage.  Basically, the Israelites rebelled against God and said they would rather go back to Egypt.  God says he was going to smite them, but Moses interceded on their behalf.  God said that he would pardon them as Moses requested.


## [Jeremiah 18:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+18%3A11&version=NASB)

(This type of verse is familiar in the old testament)

> Thus says the Lord, “Behold, I am fashioning calamity against you and devising a plan against you. Oh turn back, each of you from his evil way, and reform your ways and your deeds.”

This makes you wonder - is it an idle threat, or would God really destroy them if they don't reform their ways?  

We see multiple times that when Israel didn't repent, their nation was smashed and they were killed and taken as slaves - so I do not take it as an idle threat.  

We also see times when Israel did repent, and they lived prosperous lives (until the next time they neglected God).


## [Ezekiel 22:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+22%3A30&version=NASB)

> I searched for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before Me for the land, so that I would not destroy it; but I found no one.

That one is amazing: God is looking for someone to "stand in the gap" for the land! Unfortunately, He did not find anyone, and poured out His wrath.
