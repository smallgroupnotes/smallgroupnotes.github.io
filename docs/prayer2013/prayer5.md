# Prayer #5
*11/20/2013*
<!-- Living in Communication -->

Here is the recap from the sermon and our discussion on Sunday:

## Verses
We started out reading a few verses ([Psalm 27:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+27%3A4&version=NASB), [1 Corinthians 6:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6%3A19&version=NASB), [1 Corinthians 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+3%3A16&version=NASB), [John 15:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A4&version=NASB)) that had the theme of God's presence being with us and in us, and followed it up with [1 Thessalonians 5:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A16&version=NASB) (Pray continually).

## God's Presence

We talked about God's omnipresence being categorized 2 different ways: God's sustaining presence, and God's Holy presence.  

When sin entered the world, a division took place here on earth because His Holy presence was blocked out by sin (this was described as secular versus sacred).  God is omnipresent in the way that He sustains everything in existence.  His Holy presence, however, exists more in certain areas than others. 

In the Old Testament, His Holy presence was usually centered around the tabernacle or the temple.  In the New Testament, His Holy presence is present when people allow it in their lives.  When we ask God to be the Lord of our life, our "address" changes, and we are placed in the center of His Holy presence.  

In addition, Christ also enters us when we are saved.  This means that the moment we asked Jesus into our hearts, there is no longer a distinction between secular and sacred: Any/every place we go is a sacred place, because we are in the middle of His Holy presence.  We don't need to go to church to go to a sacred place, we don't need to go to a special place to pray, we don't even need to set aside specific times to pray, because we are *always* in the presence of God.

## Specific Prayer Times

A side note on setting aside specific times to pray:  We discussed how it is still important to set aside regular times to meet with God in prayer, but that is not the only time you can pray.  

We compared it to a marriage relationship: It is important for a couple to set aside regular times to spend quality time with each other, but the relationship is not confined to those special times.  We can communicate and build the relationship anytime we are around our spouse.  It's the same with God, only we are *always* in His presence!

## A commitment

We also heard how when we committed our life to Jesus, it was not just about the pledge we made.  It is not a matter of pledging to live your life for God and then forgetting about it for the rest of your life.  Your life is actually a series of moments strung together.  A commitment to live for God is not a one-time deal - it is a *continual* surrendering of your life, every moment of every day.

## Functional Atheists

We heard the comparison of most christian lives to "functional atheists" - which is uncomfortable to hear.  What this means is that while we do have some "sacred" times in our lives (when we go to church, pray to God, give thanks for a meal), the majority of our "normal" lives are spent without giving God a second thought - much like an atheist would spend their lives.

Instead of living like a functional atheist, we are called to abide (remain, stay) in Him, and you will bear fruit.  Abiding with His spirit produces the fruit of the spirit!  We try to produce our own fruit when we are not abiding in Him.

## Pray Continually

All of these thoughts got pulled together and connected for us with the 2-word verse of [1 Thessalonians 5:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A16&version=NASB) - Pray continually.  This sounds pretty impossible, especially in the middle of our busy lives with young children, careers, etc.  How can we pray non-stop?  This goes back to [John 15:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A4&version=NASB) where we are called to abide in Him.  It doesn't necessarily mean talking to God non-stop - It is a mindset and an awareness that we are always in His Holy presence.

## Conversations

We heard the example of how we have conversations with ourselves in our head when we think.  This sounds crazy, but if you look at how you process your thoughts, you are having mini conversations with yourself.  To abide in God's presence is to include Him on those conversations in your head.  An added benefit of including God in your ongoing thoughts is that you are making yourself more receptive to hear what God has to say to you.

## Three Tips

This all still feels daunting and very difficult, so we talked about 3 tips that can help:

1. Imagine God as your invisible friend who is always right next to you.  (Remember a couple of weeks ago when we talked about imagination, and how imagination is not just used to imagine made up things, but can also be used to bring reality closer?  This is the same thing, because, as this sermon talked about, we are always in the presence of God.  To imagine that He is sitting next to you is just picturing reality!)

2. Experiment with making your thoughts a 3-way conversations.  Include God in every thought process.  Start out with something easy or mindless, like when you are going for a jog.  Make a conscious effort to include God in your thoughts, and see how long you can keep it up.  As you practice this more and more, it will become second nature and you will be abiding in His presence. 

3. Setup reminders and accountability.  How quickly after we left on Sunday did we go on our way and forget we were in the middle of God's Holy presence?  By giving yourself reminders, and inviting other people to remind you, you can be more aware of God's presence.

## Checkpoint

So - how have you been doing on keeping your thoughts in His presence?  I'll be honest - it is hard.  I've been driving to-and-from work without the radio this week to be more conscious of His presence (I'm not saying that I'll never listen to the radio again - it just seemed like a good place to start.  Eventually, when I am dwelling in His presence more often than not, we can have conversations about what we hear on the radio!)  It seems to be getting easier, but I am so conditioned to being in my own thoughts...

## Work together

Like we also mentioned on Sunday, feel free to share tips on what helps you focus on His presence throughout the day.  The term "functional atheist" is definitely uncomfortable for me to be compared to, but probably because I know it is somewhat accurate.  By working together as a group to challenge each other, we can help each other move from being less of a functional atheist, and more of a child of God who abides in Him.

## One more thing

I just wanted to add that while sin is an obstacle to God's presence, and the fact that most of our normal lives are spent not even thinking about God - those don't cancel out what God did on the cross for us.  But by not abiding in His presence, you are missing out on hearing His direction and producing His fruit of the spirit.  

I just didn't want it to come across like you aren't saved if you aren't abiding in His presence :)  Abiding in His presence is what the human heart is hungry for, so let's let God fulfill that hunger!
