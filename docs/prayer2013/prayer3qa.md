# Prayer #3 - Q&A
*10/25/2013*

I was finally able to transcribe the questions and answers that we didn't get to listen to on Sunday.

## Question #1
### "If knowing God is so important, why doesn't God make it easier to know the truth?"

Some of the fogginess between us and God is a result of us living in a fallen world.  God doesn't will the "fog" to be there, but he can use it: he wants us to seek him ([Matthew 7:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A7&version=NASB)).  

He wants a bride who pursues him and will work on the relationship.  Those who have a heart for God will pursue and ask questions.  

There have been times in the Bible where God cuts through the fog to make himself obvious.  We can say "If only I had God speak to me through a burning bush, then I would believe" - but most of the time in the Bible when these things happened, there was an initial awe of God, but in time, that would fade away.  

When God is obvious and shows up to His people directly, it does not always have the impact you think it would.

## Question #2
### How can I increase my faith if I don't have an active imagination

You do have an imagination, you probably just aren't visual.  Think about something good that is going to happen in the near future (Job promotion, going out on a date, seeing a loved one, etc).  If you feel any excitement when thinking about this event, you are imagining it.  

Have you ever been excited about anything in the future?  If you have, it is because you were imagining what it was going to be like.  Maybe you aren't visual and can't "see" it; instead you imagine the sounds or the feeling of it - this is still your imagination.  You couldn't remember anything, or anticipate anything if you didn't have an imagination.

 

When praying, enter into that imagination, and magnify it - try to think about it with all 5 senses.  This creates a response in us as though it was real.  It is a neurological fact that the way we think and imagine is by our brain re-activating neurons in our brain that are roughly the same as when we experience it in reality.  We remember and anticipate things by replicating the reality of it in our minds.

 

Praying in faith is anticipating what we are praying for by thinking about it as though it is real.  As we discussed on Sunday, this makes us more passionate about what we are praying about and begins to align us with God's heart.

## Question #3
### How do we deal with disappointments when our prayers aren't answered?

This may be the case of the "strength tester" model of faith where you believe if you don't receive what you prayed for, you must not have had enough faith or prayed hard enough.  


Instead, start out by admitting that you don't know whether the prayer will be answered the way you want it, but knowing that your prayer will have kingdom impact.  There are so many variables that affect the outcome of prayers.  Being aware of that can help you not feel so disappointed if a prayer is not "answered".  Your prayer is a success because you are obeying God by stepping out in faith, even though you don't know what the outcome will be.  


Define success by obeying God by exercising the kind of faith He wants us to have.


## Question #4
### Why don't we see more healings happen?

*(My note: The pastor states that this answer is all his opinion.  He has no idea why we don't see more miracles, but here is a way he explains it, using an analogy)*

 

There is nothing in the New Testament that indicates that miracles were supposed to stop, but by the second century, miracles started to happen less.  In the 4th century, the church started to believe that miracles were only for the early church.  Looking through history, you can see that miracles come in pockets, or outbreaks.  Revivals happen sporadically through history, often accompanied by miracles.  

This probably isn't because we lack faith during the "down times".  


There are many other variables that are influencing what is going on.  We are in a world that is spiritually oppressed, kind of like the earth is "oppressed" by clouds that block the sunlight.  God's power is like the sun, and once in a while (for reasons we can't understand), the clouds break a little bit and the power of God falls on earth, like the sun breaking through the clouds.  

This can bring an outbreak of miracles and a revival, but eventually the clouds close up again.  The "clouds" are not equal all over the earth - they seem to be thinner in some 3rd world countries where miracles tend to happen more often.  Maybe they have more faith, or maybe there are just so many other things in those areas that we will never understand which affect the spiritual realm in their area of the earth.

 

**The bottom line**: We don't know why miracles don't happen very often, but it shouldn't affect how we live.  Continue to be obedient to God by praying in faith, and trust that God is in control.  If you are praying for someone to be healed, exercise your faith by seeing their healing as vividly as you can and press forward in your prayers for their healing.  But don't blame yourself if that person is not healed - there are so many other variables we cannot know.
