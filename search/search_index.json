In the midst of pain, grief, and mourning, the blessing of God's comfort is knowing that God is good. It doesn't mean the circumstance are better, but it is comforting to know that God is in control. A side note I thought about when thinking about point #2 was persecuted Christians. Usually when I hear stories of Christians who are being persecuted (and even put to death) the Christians are calm and many times singing. It always baffled me, until now... How do so many persecuted Christians face their persecution so calmly, and I often doubt that I would react the same way. After the study last night, I believe they are demonstrating the ultimate example of God's comfort. Their circumstances are definitely not improving - but they are taking comfort in the fact that God is good, and that he will work their bad situation out for good. I'm not sure if that is clear or not, but the idea of God's comfort in our times of mourning became very clear to me as we studied that passage. Okay - I got sidetracked :) My point was to follow up on our challenge from last night - so here it is: Challenge #1 - \"The Give Up Everything Prayer Challenge\". Go around your house in prayer, and \"donate\" everything to God. (And remember, like we mentioned last night - it already is God's!) As an added bonus, as you donate your possessions to God, ask Him to show you how you can use His possessions to impact His Kingdom. Challenge #2 - the one-percent challenge. Prayerfully consider what it would look like to give 1% more this year than you are already giving. These challenges relate to my point #1 towards the top of the email. If we are blessed when we need less of our own stuff and completely rely on God, then it is a good exercise to prayerfully consider giving (back) more. It's not really my business to know if or how much the families in this group are giving - but I think it is the business of each member of our group to encourage each other to be salt and light to the world around us - to make a Kingdom difference. I'll close with one more point from last night's meeting that has been really sticking with me: The woman who owns \"The Blessing House\". She gave everything she has to God to build and take care of large house that is used to bless anyone who can make use of it. She doesn't have any possessions - and she is blessed. She doesn't worry about theft or anything like that, because the entire house belongs to God and she is just taking care of it. That must be such a freeing feeling! Anyways, thank you all for the great discussion last night. Pray about the challenges, and let's try to encourage each other to be salt and light: to be in contact with the world but to be different from the world.","title":"Beatitudes 1b - challenge follow up"},{"location":"beatitudes2016/01-salt-and-light/","text":"The Salt and Light Revolution 01/10/2016 Intro If we manifest the qualities of the beatitudes, Jesus says we will be salt and light to the world. The beatitudes also say that if we manifest these qualities, we will be blessed. These blessings are the opposite of what the world would call blessed, which is why God's kingdom is revolutionary. Background The opinion was given that the beatitudes were targeted at the disciples, not the crowd of people that were following them. The beatitudes are not laws and commands, but they are descriptors of what a disciple should look like. Jesus wasn't saying \"Try to mourn, try to be persecuted\", etc. He was saying, \"If you follow me, you will mourn, you will be persecuted\", etc. - but you will be blessed. What does salt preserve? Being salt isn't meant to say that we are to preserve and fight for traditional values. Our job is to advance the kingdom of God not to try to run the kingdom of the world. So if our job isn't to preserve traditional values in the world around us, what should we preserve? In the Old Testament, salt was a sign of God's covenant to His people, so our job is to preserve the covenant for the world. Our presence in this world should be a constant reminder to people of how God loves them and wants to invite them into His kingdom. We are salt by manifesting what it looks like to be in a covenant relationship with God. Being separate from the world In order for salt to season and preserve food, it has to be distinct from that food but also has to remain in contact with that food. We can't be a reminder of God's covenant love and a seasoning influence in people's lives if we are no different from them. \"Be in the world, but not of the world\" Light in the darkness The purpose of being a disciple of Jesus is to serve the world by manifesting the covenant that God made with the world. As light, we should contrast the world with the kingdom of God. Our purpose and identity When we surrender our life to God, it is not just for us - our purpose is to serve the world and to be used by His kingdom. If you aren't serving others, you end up judging others. Or conversely - it will be hard to judge others if you are serving them. Jesus doesn't say you carry the light or you carry the salt - He says you are the light and you are the salt - it is our identity . In the Old Testament, God set Israel apart so that they could be an example of what it is like to live in a covenant with God - but instead they isolated themselves, got arrogant and looked down on the ones they were supposed to serve. The same thing happens with a lot of churches/christians. We aren't a light on a hill to look down on the world around us but to be a beacon of light to the world. Are we doing our job? Do our lives differ from the surrounding culture? Are we being salt and light to the people we are with in this world? Are we finding opportunities to \"mix it up\" with the world and invite them into the Kingdom. Becoming a disciple A disciple doesn't ask, \"How can I use Jesus to my benefit?\" A disciple begins to be a disciple when they ask, \"How can I be used by Jesus for His benefit?\" The kingdom isn't about crowds - the kingdom is about disciples, who make disciples. My prayer for our small group: that people would look at us and say, \"Wow - there's a group of people who display the beatitudes\" The Challenge Note: There will be a new challenge for our group every week! Pray that God would open your heart to seriously thinking about these challenges! How can we learn to be used by Jesus? What needs to change in our life to be the salt that we are called to be? Are we willing to commit to living a life that will significantly contrast with the surrounding culture? Will we seek God's wisdom on how we can arrange our life differently? So we have more time available to fellowship (grow with believers, but also do life with non-believers) So we spend less money on ourselves and have more to share We are the kingdom to the degree that we bleed/sacrifice.","title":"Beatitudes 1a - Salt and Light"},{"location":"beatitudes2016/01-salt-and-light/#the-salt-and-light-revolution","text":"01/10/2016","title":"The Salt and Light Revolution"},{"location":"beatitudes2016/01-salt-and-light/#intro","text":"If we manifest the qualities of the beatitudes, Jesus says we will be salt and light to the world.

Those who mourn: Refers to mourning of the Jews in exile. Grieving You are blessed when you have lost what you feel is most dear to you - only then can you be embraced by the one who is most dear to you. When you are poor in Spirit you can no longer rely on your own resources, ingenuity or independence. When you have lost the resources you use to empower you and figure things out on your own - Jesus says you are blessed. Poor in Spirit versus rich in the flesh Humans were created to be completely dependent on God - we were created to get all of our core worth, identity, and life from God alone. His design was that He is supposed to pour Himself into us, and as we get full of Him, we overflow towards others. But in order to get full of Him, we need to trust Him and be totally dependent on Him. Our fallen state: we have a vacuum inside us, but instead of going to God to get filled, we try to fill ourselves with people and things - these things become idols to us. An idol is anything that fills the role in our life that only God can play - this is living in the flesh. In the flesh, life becomes a feeding frenzy (from wealth, attention, good looks, reputation) to try to fill ourselves - to try to get the life that God wants to give us for free. Because this vacuum will never go away (unless God fills it), we become addicted to trying to fill it ourselves. Jesus exposes the demonic deception we are under when we think we can fill ourselves - He tells us we are blessed when we are at the end of our rope and we have lost what is most dear to us, because now we can finally get filled with God. Blessed are you when you are empty, because now you can get filled with God. Blessed are you when you don't have stuff to cling to, because now you can cling to God. God created us to have all of our needs met by Him. This is why Jesus says that it is harder for rich people to enter the kingdom of God - if you are a winner at the world's idolatry game, you can keep feeding yourself. The more you can feed yourself the more you dull the ache in your soul that hungers for God. The best thing that can happen to us is for us to lose and come to the end of ourselves - because now we can feel our need for God and be comforted by God. Can we still have wealth? Are we blessed because we have so much stuff? Having a lot of resources can be a blessing if you submit them to God. It takes a lot of character to have wealth but not feed off of it and genuinely rely completely on God. To come into the kingdom means we give everything over to the King, and become dependent on our King once again. Luke 14:33 In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples. Jesus told the rich young ruler ( Mark 10:17-27 ) that he needed to literally give away all of his possessions. Jesus knew he was seriously addicted to his possessions and couldn't rely fully on God while he kept them. Jesus allows us to legally own some things but we need to understand that it really isn't ours. What Jesus tells us we can enjoy (of His possessions) feel free to enjoy and not feel guilty about it. But if He says to give it away or share it we need to do that - because it isn't ours! To the degree we hold onto our things as though they were ours, we need to go through the mourning process of giving them up. Blessed when we mourn There are times in history when following Jesus meant you were rejected by your loved ones, treated like an alien, or even put into prison, tortured and executed - that is a kind of mourning and suffering as well. Even today, if you get radical about following Jesus, there will be times when family members or close friends get mad, worried, or uncomfortable with you. All of this sounds like a curse to our culture but Jesus calls it blessed. Our culture teaches us to avoid pain and to live life as comfortable as possible. We are blessed when we mourn our \"loss\" - because when we lose everything we can gain everything. True blessing is when you need only one thing - the love of God. Life can be lived passionately when you are no longer clinging to stuff. If we live this way, we are the sign of the covenant and we become salt and light to the world. The challenge Question: Are you really at the end of your rope? Do you rely on yourself or do you rely on God? If you genuinely rely on God it should happen now and then that you will be in trouble if God doesn't show up. If we are following Him, he will occasionally ask us to do something that doesn't follow common sense. If the answer to the question is \"no\", reorient your life around Jesus and follow Him! Challenge: In prayer, envision your life owned by God. Then pray about all of the things you own and envision them as property of Jesus. Then pray about things that are important to you (reputation, good looks, etc) and give them to God. Then pray about the loved ones in your life and give them to God. We can enjoy these things, but we cannot own them. We do life best (in a kingdom way) when we cling to nothing We dance through life with open palms, enjoying what He allows us to enjoy - being free with everything else.","title":"Beatitudes 2 - Poor in Spirit and Those who Mourn"},{"location":"beatitudes2016/02-poor-in-spirit-mourn/#poor-in-spirit-and-those-who-mourn","text":"2/14/2016","title":"Poor in Spirit and those who mourn"},{"location":"beatitudes2016/02-poor-in-spirit-mourn/#matthew-53-4","text":"","title":"Matthew 5:3-4"},{"location":"beatitudes2016/02-poor-in-spirit-mourn/#intro","text":"Poor in spirit: Someone depleted, broken, empty (rich or poor).

Empathizing in order to have compassion. Empathy: Em - into Pathos - to suffer. Enter into another's suffering Compassion: Com - alongside of Pathos - to suffer Suffer alongside or in conjunction with Mercy - enter into the suffering of another and sacrifice of your own resources to meet their needs. Mercy can also come around people with physical ailments but mercy usually deals with people who need forgiveness. God does the same for us: instead of giving us the judgment we deserve he gives us the forgiveness we don't deserve. When we surrender to God, we are given the character of mercy. The same mercy He showed to us is now in us - it becomes our identity - a part of our \"DNA\". The opposite of mercy We can't show mercy until we are willing to allow the pain of others into our life. Two things block the flow of mercy: Apathy and Judgment. Apathy: my own life is hard enough so I can't deal with others. We need to be willing to imagine what life is like in another person's shoes and collapse our judgment. Judgment in Greek means to separate. Mercy means moving towards a person and trying to get inside. Judgment separates you from a person and tries to put you above them. You can't empathize with someone while also separating from them. Love: ascribing worth to another at cost to yourself. Judgment: ascribing worth to yourself at cost to others. If we are going to be people of mercy, we need to stop judging. The only thing we can ever know for sure about someone is that they were worth Jesus dying for. Pray for your enemies. God will show you the world through their perspective. Pure in Heart Kierkegaard said: Purity of heart is to will one thing. Purity of Heart: a singular focus - not being pulled in multiple directions. Having a pure heart means you still do the things you usually do but you bring a kingdom heart and mindset into it. Seek first the Kingdom of God. Integrate God into everything and everything into God. If you have a pure heart you will see God. The Reward Is seeing God a \"prize\" for having a pure heart? Is having mercy shown towards you a \"prize\" for showing mercy? That would mean that mercy is earned - which wouldn't be mercy. The blessings of the beatitudes are natural consequences not rewards that are handed out. 1 John 3:2-3 Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure. The more you are like God - the more you will see God. The more you see God the more motivated you are to be like God - the cycle snowballs.

God created the world as a place to reflect his glory and shalom (wholeness, harmony, integration).

Romans 8:20 : For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope Futility-> Mataiot\u0113s (depravity, frailty, void of appropriateness). The world doesn't operate appropriately - it is in mataiot\u0113s. God didn't leave us in the mataiot\u0113s world - he became human in order to free us. 1 John 3:8b The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil. Jesus came to bring harmony and reconciliation - to end the mataiot\u0113s. Colossians 1:19-20 For it was the Father\u2019s good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him, and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven.

This has happened in principle (Jesus defeated sin and mataiot\u0113s) but it has not yet manifested completely. We live in an interval between the fact and the manifestation of the fact. Since God lives forever, there is virtually no time in this interval - but for humans who live so short, our perspective is that this interval is very long. We are to be people who put on display what is already true in principle. Our true identity participates in harmony and shalom. When we reflect the harmony and character of Abba Father, we are called the Children of God. Our true identity Why is there conflict in human relationships? All conflict is a result of having some aspect of our identity anchored in the mataiot\u0113s world. (Struggle to get, struggle to keep, struggle to protect). We participate in the mataiot\u0113s world when our identity is in the mataiot\u0113s world. Being a follower of Jesus means you die to the world of mataiot\u0113s. Your identity to should be 100% rooted in Jesus and Him crucified. Know that you are a child of God and have His Spirit living inside you - and now you are free from the world of mataiot\u0113s. Once your identity is anchored in God and not in the world, you can be a peacemaker.

A good example of this is a (powerful) horse that has submitted its power to its master. Are you willing to detach from your pursuit of power and control? Those who are meek will receive the earth as an inheritance from your Father. An inheritance comes to us at the proper time - not right away. Inheriting the earth Most wars have been waged over land and expansion, but Jesus said that meek will inherit the land. The meek will expand the kingdom and do spiritual warfare against the enemy. People are never the enemy - people are victims of the enemy. An inheritance is something given - not taken. Meekness versus Anger We need to hunger and thirst for a righteousness that begins with us. Meekness - also translated as gentle. Meekness is not weakness, but power under control. If Jesus calls us all to meekness it means that even the \"alpha\" types can learn the way of gentleness. A contrast to meekness is anger. Jesus mentioned anger and murder in the same sentence in Matthew 5:21-22. A common theme regarding anger in the Bible: Be gentle, don't be angry. God\u02bcs anger is righteous, because he is the Judge. John 3:36; Romans 1:18; 2:5; Ephesians 5:6; Colossians 3:6 Our anger is unrighteous, because we are not the Judge. Matthew 5:22; Ephesians 4:31; Colossians 3:8; 1 Timothy 2:8 Contrast the world's power versus Jesus Society suggests that powerful people are able to take what they need.

You are blessed when you aren't attached to pleasure and comfort. You are blessed when you aren't attached to power and being in control. Challenging questions on being meek Have I given my fears and need to be in control to God? Mark 4:40 Do I trust he will give me what I need in his time? Matthew 6:25-34 Do I have ways to remind myself to embrace my weakness and humility? John 13:14 Do I want to live as a servant of God and others? Matthew 20:25-28 Control - Fear usually drives the need to be in control. Fear that your life will go bad if you aren't in control causes you to grasp for control. Trust - Are you putting too much (all?) trust in yourself? Humility - Jesus washed the feet of his disciples. Are you willing to be humble and do something similar? Serve - Are you serving yourself, or are you serving God (and as a result, others)? The Unconditional Surrender challenge Take out a piece of paper and write down everything you want (or should) surrender to God. Pray over the list, and then sign it over to God. God wants us to unconditionally surrender our fears and our need for control and embrace the inheritance He wants to give us that is secure forever.

You are blessed when you aren't attached to pleasure and comfort. You are blessed when you aren't attached to power and being in control. When Satan tempted Jesus, he tempted Him with possessions, pleasure/comfort, and power. This shows that Jesus Himself also had to give up these things. After He was tempted, He was hungry and thirsty. When we empty ourselves of our possessions, comforts, and quest for power we become hungry and thirsty. What are you hungry and thirsty for? What is righteousness? Micah 6:8 ... And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God. Justice: Everyone is treated equally. People aren't built up at the expense of other people. Mercy: God's right way of living - the stronger serve the weaker. Seeking out ways to show compassion. Humility: Easily led. Having a modest opinion of one's own importance. Is this the dream you have for your life? Is it your passion to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly? Is that what you hunger and thirst for?

If these interactions had been any different, life (and matter itself) would not have happened. Each one of these forces that acts up on the world is called a Cosmic Constant. Examples of Comsic Constants Ratio of electromagnetic force constant. 1 in 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 chance of being able to support life. Modify that number by adding 1 or subtracting 1 and life would not be possible Strong nuclear force constant Weak nuclear force constant Gravitational force constant All of these cosmic constants (currently around 47 accepted comsic constants) need to be just right in order to support life Fine Tuning the Big Bang Big Bang Theory - citing Wikipedia : Around 13.8 billion years ago all of the matter of the universe was contained in a tiny condensed ball of matter which exploded to create the universe Some scientists hoped the universe was an oscillating universe where gravity would eventually pull all of the matter back into a condensed ball of matter and start the \"big bang\" again, but that was ruled out when it was discovered that the expansion of our universe is accelerating, not slowing down What are the chances that you can get all 47 cosmic constants right in just one try ? Imagine very big dice with 10^40 sides to it. The odds of rolling a 17 are 1 in 10^40 power. What are the chances that you could roll a 17 47 times in a row ? Don't roll a 17 any one of those times and life is not possible. Anyone would conclude that there are external forces (someone with intelligence) involved if you could roll a 3 in dice 10 times in a row. Why would you not also conclude that there is an intelligent creator to \"roll\" the perfect universe of a 10^40 sided-die 47 times in a row ? It is a reasonable conclusion that there is a God behind the universe. The only way around this conclusion is that there are infinite universes and our universe is the one that can support life. There is no evidence for this theory. It seems to take more faith to assume that chance could bring about our world instead of the faith it takes to assume that God created it Argument #2 - Anthropological argument Anthropological argument: We learn something about God and His existence from the way in which we are made.

This longing is out of place in the evolutionary universe. If there is a rational, moral being that created the universe, we can begin to understand why we have these longings Conclusion According to the big God story - our rational, moral God created us, became one of us, and took our sin from us - all with the purpose of Jesus Christ. Jesus is the reason for everything - he is our purpose. Our fulfilment can be found in him We have all the reasons to believe that God's story is true - and that makes our future very bright.

The Bible's perfect imperfection Intro We worship God with our heart, soul, strength, and mind ( Mark 12:30 ) When we wrestle with issues and think passionately about the Bible we are worshipping God. Why believe in the Bible? Don't use circular reasoning to justify your belief in the Bible The argument for Biblical inspiration Food for thought: Rather than basing your belief in Jesus on the Bible - base your belief in the Bible on Jesus There are strong, historical reasons to believe in Jesus and that Jesus is Lord Jesus believed that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God (He frequently quoted the OT, and even quoted God speaking in the OT. Also, see Luke 24:44 ) Jesus also pre-authorized the New Testament (See John 16:12 , John 14:26 for examples) If we confess that Jesus is Lord and he believed the OT and NT were inspired by God, we must also believe that OT and NT were inspired by God. 2 Timothy 3:16 - All scripture is God breathed The doctrine of inerrancy Inerrancy: lack of error; infallibility Many evangelicals (who believe that the Bible is God breathed) believe that any inaccuracies or mistakes in the Bible must only be perceived and they try to explain them away. They believe that a perfect God would breathe a perfect book This view could be dangerous It sets people up for a fall If you believe that the Bible is free from any error but later are presented with evidence that there are errors that you can't explain, you assume that maybe it isn't divinely inspired and therefore Jesus was wrong for endorsing the Bible as God's word This message will examine some errors and contradictions that are found in the Bible It will also show that these errors contribute to the inspiration of the Bible \"Problems\" in the Bible It is a perfectly imperfect book Problem #1 - Ancient (Pre-Scientific) Cosmology Examples: The writers of the OT believed the sky was a hard dome that held up water ( Job 37:18 , Genesis 1:7 ) They believed God opened windows in the dome to produce rain ( Malachi 3:10 ) Mythological Sea Monsters ( Psalm 74:14 , Job 41 ) These writers were correct that there were evil forces threatening the earth but they were misplaced in what these forces actually were Problem #2 - Contradictions in the Bible 2 Samuel 24:1 says that God caused David to sin by having him take a census of his army. This is later corrected in 1 Chronicles 21:1 where it says that it was Satan that incited David to take the census Exodus 34:7 & Numbers 14:18 say that God judges generations based on their parents\u2019/ancestors\u2019 sins, but Ezekiel 18:20 says that God will not judge generations based on their parents\u2019/ancestors\u2019/ sins Evidence of a progress of revelation - early on the authors didn't understand God enough but later on authors had a deeper relationship with God Problem #3 - Human Mistakes 1 Corinthians 1:14-16 - Paul changes his story within these verses Mark 1:2 - Mark quotes a Scripture reference and says it\u2019s from Isaiah\u2026but it is actually from Malachi 3:1 Mark 2:26 - Jesus references an incident that took place under \u201c Abiathar the high priest,\u201d but the high priest during this instance was actually Abiathar\u2019s father \u2013 Ahimelech in 1 Samuel 21:1-6 Matthew 27:9 ( NOTE: Speaker says Jeremy instead of Jeremiah ) - Jesus references a scripture from Jeremiah\u2026but it was actually found in Zachariah 11:13 , not Jeremiah Problem #4 - Un-Christ-like Pictures of God Deuteronomy 20:16-17 - God commands the death of men, women, children, and, animals We should try not to assume what a perfect God would do It makes sense to common reason that a perfect God would write a perfect book - but multiple examples in scripture show that God/Jesus does things opposite of what people expect The disciples (and early Jews) assumed what the messiah would do - but Jesus did the opposite Rather than assuming what it means for a perfect God to breathe a revelation of himself - it is wiser to let God teach us One of the places to learn is the place where God fully reveals himself - on the cross Consideration #1 - God's perfect revelation on the cross What would it look like for God to reveal his power? Most people would assume it would be impressive, but when God reveals his power it appears foolish ( 1 Corinthians 1:18,24 ) The message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for destruction! But we who are being saved know it is the very power of God. If God revealed himself through Christ on the cross, who embodied everything that is wrong with this world, why would we assume that the scripture (that is designed to point people to the cross) should be free of imperfections? If God breathed his fullest revelation through something that appears foolish and weak (read 1 Corinthians 1:18,24 again) shouldn't we expect the Bible to include foolish and weak things? The Bible should contain sin and imperfections because it points to the cross Consideration #2 - God's breathing is not unilateral Unilateral: An action or decision performed by or affecting only one person, group, or country involved in a particular situation, without the agreement of another or the others. To assume that God would breathe a perfect book assumes that God and God only breathes into the Bible and nothing else gets mixed in with what God breathes. The Bible was not unilaterally-breathed - it is relationally-breathed - this is why the Bible gets mixed up with imperfect stuff God on the cross involves allows imperfect people to act towards him and condition how he appears God on the cross allows all of the imperfections of humanity to act on him The cross is both beautiful and ugly Beautiful because it reveals God acting towards us, to become what is opposite of himself, out of love for us Ugly because it allows people to act towards him. The cross mirrors the ugliness of the sin of the world The Bible will look beautiful to the degree that it reflects God acting towards us and it will look ugly (and imperfect and weak) to the degree that it reflects humanity acting towards God. Imperfections in the Bible reveal God's love If God can breathe his perfect revelation through the one who bears all of the sins and imperfections of the world, why would we think it is a problem that God could breathe through the imperfections of the authors of the Bible? These imperfections confirm what the cross reveals about God: God enters into solidarity with us and uses us as we are God manifests his perfection through human imperfections, his beauty through human ugliness, his holiness through human sin.

The general theme of what we discussed had to do with letting yourself be loved by God - how can we fully love God and others, if we are not fully feeling the love from God? God-shaped hole The quote we heard at the beginning was: \"Everything we need we've already got - we are full in Christ Jesus. The only problem is that we think we have a problem - so we spend all of our time trying to get what He has already given us for free. The very act of us trying to get it prevents us from experiencing it for free.\" This has to do with the \"God shaped hole\" we have in our lives. Basically - the time we spend trying to fill the \"God shaped holes\" in our lives are keeping us from experiencing a full relationship with Him - which is the only thing that can fill the holes in our lives. Hearing these words are not enough, though - we need an actual transformation in our lives - and a major way we can experience this transformation is by leaving behind the old names we have been called and embracing the new names God has given us. Significance of names We discussed the passage in Daniel 1:6-7 where the king changed the names of the Hebrew captives. In those days, their names were more than a label - there names were phrases that had significant meaning. The king changed their names because he knew how powerful a name is to a person, and how he could use their names to bend them. Here are the names of the 4 Hebrews and what they were changed to: Daniel - God is my Judge Balshazar - Guarded by Ba'al Hananiah - The Lord is gracious Shadrach - Under Aku's command Mishael - Who is like God Meshach - Who is like Sheshach Azariah - The Lord is my helper Abednego - Slave of Nebo We talked about how amazing it would be if your name actually was \"The Lord is my helper\" - if every time someone talked to you, they called you that. If you heard that over and over, every day of your life. That would have to impact you. I'm sure some days, you glaze over it because you heard it so much, but overall, it would have a positive impact on you. The opposite is true - if you had a bad name, that would be such a negative impact. We also heard that generally, the person who names someone usually has some authority over the person they are naming. The summary of this is that names are very powerful, and can be a blessing or a curse in someone's life. Our names In our society, our names are more labels or social cues. Some of us know what the meaning of our name is, but it is usually not something we dwell on very often. However, as we have grown up, we usually give names to ourselves, or others have given us names whether they intended to or not. Some examples of good names people can receive: \"You are a blessing to us\", \"You are loved by God\", \"You are an amazing person\", etc. Some example of bad names people get are: \"You are ugly\", \"You are stupid\", \"You can't do anything right\", \"No one likes you\", etc. We can easily see that if you heard these names (good or bad) over and over, they would definitely impact your life. A new name The focal point in our discussion was how when we became Christians, God gave us a new name, and we don't have to listen to the our old, bad names any more. It takes time to learn to respond to a new name. It takes even more time to stop responding to old ones that are lies about who you are. But remember that Christ is the Truth, and you are in Christ, therefore in the Truth. We need to let our \"I am\" names be defined by the Great \"I AM\"! We also heard that Daniel and his friends probably didn't always live up to their awesome names - but that doesn't mean their names were not valid. When you mess up, dust yourself off and remember that the sin does not define you - remember who you really are in Jesus. Summary The 3 points we heard in summary were: Start noticing your the names you have been called, especially when you make choices that don't align with God's will. Don't notice these names to get down on yourself - just to realize that there is a name you have been answering to. Stop the influence of the bad names, by remembering your true names in Christ. Use the old names to serve as a reminder of your new name. For example, when you hear your old name \"You are stupid, you can't do anything right\" - use that to remember the name God gave you: \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me!\" Try to make your names in Christ a part of your subconscious - dwell on these names, and let the truth sink in. A Challenge As a wrap up, I challenged all of us to search the Bible for names that God has given you, and share them with the group. Here are the names that I have been finding (I use the NAS translation in case these verses didn't translate the same in other translations): I am a delight to God - Zephaniah 3:17 God rejoices over me with shouts of joy! - Zephaniah 3:17 I am loved by God - John 3:16 God loves me with an everlasting love - Jeremiah 31:3 I am valuable to God - Matthew 10:30-31 God is for me - Romans 8:31 I am God's friend - John 15:14 I am forgiven - Acts 10:43, Colossians 1:14 I am whiter than snow - Psalm 51:7 God pours His love over me - Romans 5:5 I am God's handiwork - Ephesians 2:10 God fellowships with me - 1 Corinthians 1:9 God's love for me is boundless - Ephesians 3:17-19 I am clothed with Christ - Galatians 3:27 God gives me strength - Isaiah 40:29 God covers me with His hand - Exodus 33:22 I am blameless - Colossians 1:22 God draws me near to Him - Hebrews 7:19","title":"Love 1 - Knowing your name"},{"location":"love2014/love1/#love-1","text":"1/21/2014 Here is the recap from last Sunday on \"Knowing your name\".

As I mentioned, this sermon was loaded with so much good stuff and seemed to have two topics in it, so we split it into two parts. Two Parts This past week we covered \"It's All About Love (Part 1)\" which talked about how much God loves us. Next week we will cover \"It's All About Love (Part 2)\" which will talk about letting God's love flow out of us into other people. Scripture The scripture that we read was: John 17:19-26 - the key in this passage was that it showed that God loves us, God's love is in us, and God Himself is in us. John 3:16 - The key word in this familiar passage is \"gave\". God loved, so He gave. 1 John 3:16 - We know love by this: God laid down His life for us. Definition of love We started out by hearing the definition of love at its very basic core: Giving, sacrificing, ascribing worth to someone or something. We talked about how you can love something to a certain degree - and you can usually tell the degree to which you love someone or something by how much you are willing to sacrifice for them (remember this sentence for later on). Love has limits An example we heard was the family dog. The pastor loved the dog enough to pay $30/haircut, and a $300 surgery for his dog. But when the doctor recommended a $1200 proactive surgery, he drew the line. This shows that love has limits. The flipside of knowing the limits of Love is to realize that God's love has no limits! Then we transitioned to talking about how much God loves us, and how this was important to know. How can we give God's pure, overflowing love if we do not understand it, or we do not realize we are overflowing with it? How much does God love you? So how much does God love you? Remember back a couple of paragraphs ago to the core of love? If you can tell the degree to which you love someone by how much you sacrifice for them, what did God sacrifice for you? The obvious \"Sunday School\" answer is \"Jesus\" - and that is true. But the way this sermon described it is amazing: God gave His only begotten Son - God became a human. We are so worth it to Him, that he crossed the infinite gulf that separates God from humanity to live among us. But that's not all: He also allowed Himself to die a nightmarish death on the cross for us. He allowed Himself to take on all of the sin of the earth throughout history. He allowed Himself to take the punishment for those sins. He allowed Himself to experience God forsakenness. Jesus experienced something He had never experienced before: God abandonment and God's judgment. He could not have done more than He did for you. He could not have sacrificed anything more. So again with the question: If you can tell the degree to which you love someone by how much you sacrifice for them, and knowing that He could not have sacrificed anything more for you, how much does that say about His love for you? How near are we to God's love? Now that we are beginning to understand the extent of God's love for you, we looked again at the passage from John 17 and how God's love is in us - and God Himself is in us. There is perfect love between the trinity - and that is the very same love that is directed at you! ( John 17:26 - so that the love with which You (God) loved Me (Jesus) may be in them (us!), and I in them). This means that as you sit here reading this as a believer, you could not be more the object of God's love than you are right now. His perfect, complete love can't get any better! This is hard to grasp as humans, because as we discussed, we have limits to our love. God's love, being limitless, cannot increase for you anymore - meaning, it is as high as it can go! The depth of God's love for you We discussed this analogy: Picture someone that you consider to love the most . Get an image of them in your mind. Notice the feelings you have for them. Now, imagine yourself in their spot (being the object of love), and put God in your spot (the giver of love) - looking at you with the same love - because when He is looking at you with Love, He is looking at Jesus. That love you experience for someone is how God loves you - only, multiply it by thousands, millions, billions, trillions. Can you imagine loving your child any more than you already do? Multiply that by the biggest number you can imagine, and now you are beginning to see how much God loves you... When you see yourself being loved by God that way, you are living as God intended it to be when He created humans. After the fall, we all have a whole in our hearts, and that perfect love of God is the only thing that can fill it. I love you too We finished up hearing Beth Moore talk about she saw an amazing sunset and was overwhelmed with God's love for her. She heard God tell her, for a while, don't say \"I love you God\", but to instead say \"I love you too, God\". The scripture that she related to this experience was I John 4:19 : We love, because He first loved us. God is the source of love. Our ability to love God isn't in us - it comes from God. Transition to Part 2 The love that God has for us is not only towards us, it is in us. But it doesn't just stay in us - we are conduits of God's love to the people around us. We briefly talked about how sometimes it feels like we have to muster up love for the people who aren't very lovable - but in reality, God's love is already overflowing in us - we just have to not block it, and let it flow towards others! Being recipients of God's love defines who we are in Christ. Being conduits of God's love defines what we do in Christ. Wrap up We had such an amazing discussion of this amazing material. It is hard to imagine how deep God loves us, but once we start realizing this, the abundance of love will be flowing out of us like crazy! This is why we had the \"assignment\" to be aware of God's love for you this week, and to share it with the group... Be aware of it! Experience His crazy love for you!

God loved, so He gave. 1 John 3:16 - We know love by this: God laid down His life for us.","title":"Scripture"},{"location":"love2014/love2/#definition-of-love","text":"We started out by hearing the definition of love at its very basic core: Giving, sacrificing, ascribing worth to someone or something. We talked about how you can love something to a certain degree - and you can usually tell the degree to which you love someone or something by how much you are willing to sacrifice for them (remember this sentence for later on).","title":"Definition of love"},{"location":"love2014/love2/#love-has-limits","text":"An example we heard was the family dog. The pastor loved the dog enough to pay $30/haircut, and a $300 surgery for his dog. But when the doctor recommended a $1200 proactive surgery, he drew the line. This shows that love has limits. The flipside of knowing the limits of Love is to realize that God's love has no limits! Then we transitioned to talking about how much God loves us, and how this was important to know. How can we give God's pure, overflowing love if we do not understand it, or we do not realize we are overflowing with it?","title":"Love has limits"},{"location":"love2014/love2/#how-much-does-god-love-you","text":"So how much does God love you? Remember back a couple of paragraphs ago to the core of love? If you can tell the degree to which you love someone by how much you sacrifice for them, what did God sacrifice for you? The obvious \"Sunday School\" answer is \"Jesus\" - and that is true. But the way this sermon described it is amazing: God gave His only begotten Son - God became a human. We are so worth it to Him, that he crossed the infinite gulf that separates God from humanity to live among us. But that's not all: He also allowed Himself to die a nightmarish death on the cross for us. He allowed Himself to take on all of the sin of the earth throughout history. He allowed Himself to take the punishment for those sins. He allowed Himself to experience God forsakenness. Jesus experienced something He had never experienced before: God abandonment and God's judgment. He could not have done more than He did for you. He could not have sacrificed anything more. So again with the question: If you can tell the degree to which you love someone by how much you sacrifice for them, and knowing that He could not have sacrificed anything more for you, how much does that say about His love for you?","title":"How much does God love you?"},{"location":"love2014/love2/#how-near-are-we-to-gods-love","text":"Now that we are beginning to understand the extent of God's love for you, we looked again at the passage from John 17 and how God's love is in us - and God Himself is in us. There is perfect love between the trinity - and that is the very same love that is directed at you! ( John 17:26 - so that the love with which You (God) loved Me (Jesus) may be in them (us!), and I in them). This means that as you sit here reading this as a believer, you could not be more the object of God's love than you are right now. His perfect, complete love can't get any better! This is hard to grasp as humans, because as we discussed, we have limits to our love. God's love, being limitless, cannot increase for you anymore - meaning, it is as high as it can go!","title":"How near are we to God's love?"},{"location":"love2014/love2/#the-depth-of-gods-love-for-you","text":"We discussed this analogy: Picture someone that you consider to love the most . Get an image of them in your mind. Notice the feelings you have for them. Now, imagine yourself in their spot (being the object of love), and put God in your spot (the giver of love) - looking at you with the same love - because when He is looking at you with Love, He is looking at Jesus. That love you experience for someone is how God loves you - only, multiply it by thousands, millions, billions, trillions. Can you imagine loving your child any more than you already do? Multiply that by the biggest number you can imagine, and now you are beginning to see how much God loves you... When you see yourself being loved by God that way, you are living as God intended it to be when He created humans. After the fall, we all have a whole in our hearts, and that perfect love of God is the only thing that can fill it.","title":"The depth of God's love for you"},{"location":"love2014/love2/#i-love-you-too","text":"We finished up hearing Beth Moore talk about she saw an amazing sunset and was overwhelmed with God's love for her.

This is life-changing!","title":"What happens if our actions are not done in love?"},{"location":"love2014/love3/","text":"Love #3 2/11/2014 Here is the recap from our last meeting, where we discussed how love is (or should be) the center of all that we do. We started out with a transition from our previous discussion, where we described God's love not only being toward you, but that it is also in you. We aren't just recipients of God's love (that is who we are), we are replicators and conduits of God's love (that is what we do). Three parts of love I accidentally skipped a clip, so I will summarize what was in that clip here: There are 3 parts to God's love: * His love flowing to us * His love dwelling in us * His love flowing through us. Those 3 parts must be together - you can't separate them. Because of His love in us, there should be 3 results in our life: We reflect that love back to God (worship), we affirm our own worth in God, and we affirm the worth of others. These three things are inseparable as well - you can't do one without doing the others. If anyone says they love God but don't love their neighbor, they are a liar. A side note on affirming your own worth in God: The Bible is not against self-love. Love your neighbor as yourself . You affirm the worth you have because of who God is. The greatest commandment Matthew 22:36-39 - when someone asked Jesus what the greatest commandment was, Jesus gave 2 commandments, because you can't do one without the other. Love God with all your heart AND love your neighbor as yourself. This is the central thing the Christian life is supposed to be about. Above all 1 John 4:21 : And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also. 1 Corinthians 16:14 : Let all that you do be done in love. Colossians 3:14a : Beyond all these things put on love 1 Peter 4:8 : Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins. Galatians 5:14 : For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d An analogy The analogy we heard was to think about clothing yourself with love like you would wear clothes. None of us would go to work, church, school, the store, etc without wearing our clothes. We don't even have to think about it, right? \"Wearing\" love should be just like that. We don't have to wonder, \"Should I be loving in this situation?\" - the answer is always yes! This is a given: love continually. Love continually We also talked about that if we can do this (love all the time), everything else will fall into place. Gossip, stealing, etc - if your goal is to love others ALL the time, it will be impossible to gossip, steal, etc. Love all the time, and everything falls into place, but the opposite is true: don't love all the time, and you will struggle with all the other things. Anything without love is worthless This sounds really harsh. But look at the familiar passage of 1 Corinthians 13:1-3 : If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing. Here is what Paul says about your actions if they are not backed up with love - your actions are: A noisy gong, a clanging symbol, worth nothing. All of those actions can be great, and they may look really good, but if they aren't founded in love, they are nothing. Actions without love can be dangerous We discussed how sometimes Christians or churches can put certain principles or actions above love. These things can look very good, but if they aren't done in love, they can be evil. This is not saying to ignore any parts of the Bible that don't deal with love - but if you take things from the Bible and put them above love, you use it loving some of the time (when people agree with you), but it also can be used to hurt (especially when people don't agree with you). Even the devil can quote the Bible, but he doesn't do it in love. Our small group We also heard how a church can have the best programs, give the best sermons, have the best music, but if the end product isn't people who live in an outrageous, radical, ridiculous love, all of those good things aren't worth it. I related this to our group. I desperately want our group to be founded in love so that as we go out from our group, God's love is carried out to those around us - maybe not even intentionally, but that people around us would constantly be affected by God's love flowing through us. Stay awake Stay awake to the love God has given you. As you live your life and encounter people, ask this question to yourself about every person you are around: How can I affirm the infinite worth of this person for whom Christ died? This person has infinite value to God! Differing situations Sharing love with people will look different in each situation: You will show love to your kids differently than you would show love to someone at the store. And as we discussed, maybe it isn't even about an action. You don't necessarily need to go out of your way to give love to every person around you. Maybe when everyone is giving a smoker a dirty look when they walk by, you smile at them. When everyone is staring at the parent of the kid throwing a tantrum, maybe you just go about your business like nothing is bothering you. That simple act of not judging them can be showing love to them. The point is: you can always show love, and you should never not show love (see all the verses above). Tough situations We had discussion about how sometimes it can require God's wisdom on how to show love in certain situations: discipline, being a manager of employees, etc. Sometimes it can feel unloving to correct someone, but just think about them as being infinitely loved by God, and think about how you can correct someone in a loving manner. In a few weeks, we will go into this in more detail. When we don't live in love This whole discussion was centered around love, and how God commands us, above all things, all the time to Love. When I actually think about this as a command from God, and then think about how often I have not done this, I realize how often I have disobeyed God's greatest commandment... The redeeming part of this, though, is that God saved us with His grace, and he still pours his outrageous love on us, just waiting for us to share it with others. A challenge Think of one person that you know you don't show love. Maybe you don't hate them, but you definitely haven't ascribed to them the infinite worth they have in God. Pray that God would help you speak, act, and think about this person in love. Maybe you still feel yucky about them - maybe they have hurt you... but like the verse above, love is so powerful it can cover a multitude of sins. Also pray for forgiveness for all the times you did not love this person. My personal challenge We didn't discuss this on Sunday, but I would like to take this a step further. I would like to issue myself a personal challenge: When I see how incredibly important it is for us to live in love, and how everything we do must be done in love, I want to change the way I live. This is going to be my focus during this series we are doing as a small group, and I am praying my life will be changed as a result. I want my life to change to the point where love becomes so embedded that I don't even have to think intentionally about loving someone. I want to clothe myself in love. I commit to you guys that I will work on being more intentional about living in love. I know it will be hard at first and I know I will fail, but I can't wait until it is a natural part of my daily life. As my closest group of spiritual friends, I give you permission to keep me accountable, and to challenge me when you see me not acting in a way that is loving. I'm not sharing this challenge to force you into anything. Like I shared on Sunday, my prayer and vision for the group is that we become a group of love, where love comes pouring out of us. This personal challenge is the first step for me. My intent in sharing my personal challenge is to look to you guys for support and to encourage you guys to always be growing. Be honest with God and stretch yourself to grow a little bit at a time. If you feel like God is laying an area on your heart where you could grow, and want accountability, what better group of people than our small group to share it with and ask for help. Only you know where you stand with God, and maybe you need to just dwell on the first two lessons we covered about knowing your name in Christ, and learning more about how God loves you. Maybe you are already really good at loving those around you and you can be a support for the rest of the group. Conclusion You guys are awesome - I thoroughly enjoy working through this stuff with you all, and having the conversations we are able to have together. Have a blessed week!","title":"Love 3 - It's all about love part 2"},{"location":"love2014/love3/#love-3","text":"2/11/2014 Here is the recap from our last meeting, where we discussed how love is (or should be) the center of all that we do.

Also pray for forgiveness for all the times you did not love this person.","title":"A challenge"},{"location":"love2014/love3/#my-personal-challenge","text":"We didn't discuss this on Sunday, but I would like to take this a step further. I would like to issue myself a personal challenge: When I see how incredibly important it is for us to live in love, and how everything we do must be done in love, I want to change the way I live. This is going to be my focus during this series we are doing as a small group, and I am praying my life will be changed as a result. I want my life to change to the point where love becomes so embedded that I don't even have to think intentionally about loving someone. I want to clothe myself in love. I commit to you guys that I will work on being more intentional about living in love. I know it will be hard at first and I know I will fail, but I can't wait until it is a natural part of my daily life. As my closest group of spiritual friends, I give you permission to keep me accountable, and to challenge me when you see me not acting in a way that is loving. I'm not sharing this challenge to force you into anything. Like I shared on Sunday, my prayer and vision for the group is that we become a group of love, where love comes pouring out of us. This personal challenge is the first step for me. My intent in sharing my personal challenge is to look to you guys for support and to encourage you guys to always be growing. Be honest with God and stretch yourself to grow a little bit at a time. If you feel like God is laying an area on your heart where you could grow, and want accountability, what better group of people than our small group to share it with and ask for help. Only you know where you stand with God, and maybe you need to just dwell on the first two lessons we covered about knowing your name in Christ, and learning more about how God loves you. Maybe you are already really good at loving those around you and you can be a support for the rest of the group.","title":"My personal challenge"},{"location":"love2014/love3/#conclusion","text":"You guys are awesome - I thoroughly enjoy working through this stuff with you all, and having the conversations we are able to have together.

I thought it was an awesome analogy and had to share it with you - this is my paraphrase from memory, so hopefully I do it justice: Let's make up a new carnival game, where the object of the game is to throw a ball and knock over fuzzy little stuffed animals (that are, of course, ridiculously hard to knock over). In the center of all the fuzzy animals is a fuzzy bear - the only bear out of all the other stuffed animals. Here is the rule: The only way to win a prize in this game is to knock over the bear. In fact, if you are able to knock over the bear, you get all of the prizes in the booth! If you knock over any of the other animals, it doesn't count for anything - you don't win any prizes. So here is the (obvious) question: If you were playing this carnival game, which animal would you spend all of your time trying to knock over? What would you spend all of your time on - what would your focus be? I'm sure you already see the analogy with what we discussed about love. If the Bible says, \"Above all, above everything else, love\", what should we focus on? We can spend our time trying to knock over the other \"animals\" of donating stuff to the poor, giving generously, etc, but if we don't do it in love, it wasn't worth it. Sure, it looks impressive if I'm zoned in and can knock over animal after animal in that game - Wow! Nice shot! Great aim! You really know how to knock those animals over! But if I didn't knock over the bear - big deal, right? Just like 1 Corinthians 13:1-3 says - I can fathom all mysteries and knowledge, give all of my possessions to the poor, have faith to move mountains - Wow! Nice Job! You really are a model Christian - just look what you can do! But then the passage finishes with: But if I do not have love, I gain nothing, I am nothing, I am a clanging cymbal - it's just religious noise. Those other things are important and good, yes - but first, we need to work on love: living love, being clothed in love, doing everything in love. Once we do everything in love - imagine the effectiveness of our actions - imagine the glory that goes to God!

Verses 1 Corinthians 16:14 Let all that you do be done in love Colossians 3:14 Beyond all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity. Galatians 5:14 For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d 1 John 4:20 If someone says, \u201cI love God,\u201d and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. 1 John 4:8 The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. 1 John 4:12 No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us. 1 John 4:16 We have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. 1 John 4:21 And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also. John 13:35 By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another. Luke 6:28 Bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. Luke 6:35a Love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return Matthew 10:8b Freely you received, freely give. Verse for the night Galatians 5:6 (NIV) For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. Intro We have been reviewing a lot about how important love is \u2013 and it is very familiar to many of us. But that is the problem: We have known these verses for most of our lives, so when we hear it again, we don\u2019t really hear it. We know it, but we don\u2019t really know it. As we study this \u2013 pretend you don\u2019t know anything about love. The center of a christian What would be the first thing people think of when they think of Christians? There would probably be some good things, probably a lot of negative things. But how many people would immediately think of the word \u201clove\u201d? If there is any one thing we are to impress upon the world, it is love \u2013 God\u2019s love. The central mark of the believer is to abide in God\u2019s love, let God\u2019s love abide in you, and overflow that love to others. That is what it means to be a Christian! How should we love others? As Christ loved us. Why should we love? John 17:21 \u2013 so that the world may know that God sent Jesus to love them. The other things in the Christian life are great \u2013 but if love isn\u2019t first place, they don\u2019t even matter. There is no bigger indictment on the church than when people have to be protected from the church. The place of love Abiding in God \u2013 the center. The place that should be our home. We don\u2019t live there all the time, but we need to remember that it is our home. When you live in this place, you begin to see others as God sees them, you begin to ascribe worth to people as God does. You begin to take on God\u2019s heart when you live in this place. This place is love. All of the judgment and \u201cpollution\u201d that is in our mind goes away when we are in this place. Even if you dislike someone \u2013 even if you think they are immoral \u2013 in this place, those thoughts come to an end because that is not your job description. In this place, the only thing on your mind is the infinite worth of this person. What you see is love, what you think about is love \u2013 because that is our only job description. In this place is joy itself! To abide in God is to take residence in God \u2013 and that is to take residence in love. You see everyone through the eyes of Jesus, and you become free from yourself. The goal of this study is to move our residence to this place. The only thing that matters Galatians 5:6 : For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. The Galatians (like many Christians today) put too much worth on extra things, like circumcision. God gave us grace \u2013 and through that grace, we are saved. The Galatians (and many Christians today) say \u201cgrace plus X equals what really matters.\" Sure, we have grace, but we also need this or that to improve our standing with Christ. In Galatians 5:6 , Paul is saying that all of those other things don\u2019t matter. \u201cThe only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.\u201d When you take grace and add anything to it, it is no longer grace. How can we try to increase our worth to God when it can\u2019t be surpassed? Faith through love Faith being manifested through love: Faith that we believe who we are in Christ and faith to believe that the people around you have unsurpassable worth in Christ. When we really believe this, we act on it. Faith without works (actions) is dead. This is why the only thing that matters is love. The energy of faith is love. The thing that makes faith work is love. Faith, by itself, if it has no works, is dead ( James 2:26 ). This is not saying we need to add works in order to have faith. What it is saying that faith that isn\u2019t dead, works. It has energy to it. The energy of faith is love. When you ascribe unsurpassable worth to someone, you do something about it. This is why love needs to be in first place. Balancing love with judgment Some people think that you can\u2019t just focus on love - People will never overcome their sins if you don\u2019t hold them accountable for those sins. There is a place to confront sin \u2013 when people have asked you to keep them accountable, or you are in strong, Christian relationship with them. But judgment does not empower someone to overcome sin \u2013 it condemns them. Love is what gives someone power to overcome the sin in their life. Being blessed Christians often pray to be blessed by God, which is a good thing - the intention is good. But the best way you can get blessed, is to start blessing on others: You pray for blessings on others, you get blessed. You help others, you get helped. You give to others, you get. When you stop looking for advantages for yourself, and start trying to give to others, it all comes back to you.

We then read Genesis 3:1-7 Provision and Prohibition We talked about how the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil were at the center of the garden ( Genesis 2:9 ). The importance of this is that in the paradise that God wants for us, there is a provision and a prohibition at the center. The provision is the tree of life - God will meet our needs. The prohibition is a boundary: leave to God what belongs to God (in this case, the knowledge of good and evil). God's job is to judge good and evil - Our job is to reflect God's love to others. The center When Eve at the fruit, she put her own will at the center of her life, and everything revolved around her. The same goes with us after the fall: we are the center of our existence - we see the world through our own eyes. When we put ourselves at the center, we cut ourselves off from the source of our life, and we try to get that life from everything around us. We live our lives out of hunger rather than fullness. When we try to meet our own needs, we bring in our knowledge of good and evil, and evaluate things and people around us by judging them. Example: Do I like this kind of food, do I not like it. Do I agree with that person, do I disagree with them. Do I like that, do I dislike it? We evaluate everything around us. We have a perpetual commentary of judgement in our minds that we were never meant to have. And all of these judgmental thoughts chokes off the one thing we were called to do: love. God is able to love and judge at the same time - but we are not able to do this, which is why he prohibited it. Good judgement - Discernment There is a time for routine judgement (analyzing things that could be dangerous), and there can even be a time to use our knowledge of good an evil to help Christian brothers. If you are in an accountability relationship with someone who has invited you to let them know when they do things not consistent with God, that is a time where you can provide input. But if the person has not invited you to do this, our job is to love them. Any other judging that we do is simply a way of feeding ourselves - making you feel better about yourself. You are drinking from a tree you were never made to drink of. What we know and don't know One quote we heard a few times during our study was, \"You need to know what you know, and know what you don't know\". Know what you know : we know that God is in control, so we need to trust Him on everything else. We know God didn't intend for us to have the knowledge of good and evil, so leave that up to Him. Know what you don't know : You don't know the big picture, so let God handle it. You don't know the situation of the person you want to judge, so don't judge them! When we judge someone, you are acting like you have all of the information (which you don't - but God does). Excuses! Another good point we talked about: We are very good at excusing our own behavior (the kids kept me up late, things are real stressful at work, etc), but we rarely try to explain other people's behavior - we usually just snap to a judgement about them. The cross of Jesus We also heard the statement that our life could be governed by this mentality: learning to see God, see ourselves, and see others through the cross of Jesus (the love that He gave on the cross could not have been any more perfect). When this view gets blocked, we start to get our life by questioning others, questioning ourselves, and questioning God. When that happens, we don't go to God to get life, and when we aren't receiving that life and love from God, we can't give it to others. Don't block the flow All of the above illustrates how judgment starts to block out the flow of God's love in our lives, and certainly blocks us from letting God's love flow to others. Note - I'm not saying that God's love stops flowing to us when we live in judgement - I'm just saying that we aren't getting our life from that love. Just like the sun is always shining even though we might not always feel it . A Challenge Spend time getting rooted and grounded in God's love. It takes time - set aside time to drink of God's love for you. Let God love on you. Try to practice being in the presence of God at all times. Remember that in every moment, God's perfect love is being directed at you! But also remember that His love is directed at the people around you. Abide in God's love!","title":"Love 5"},{"location":"love2014/love5/#love-5","text":"3/19/2014 Here is the recap from the study we did a week and a half ago:","title":"Love #5"},{"location":"love2014/love5/#intro","text":"We started out with a quick summary from our previous weeks, about how important God's love is (Letting God love us, loving ourselves, and God's love flowing out to others).

Abide in God's love!","title":"A Challenge"},{"location":"love2014/love6/","text":"Love #6 3/8/2014 Here is the recap from our last discussion: Intro We started out asking the question: What keeps us from fully experiencing God's love for us? Until we understand what keeps us from receiving God\u2019s love, we will never be able to freely give His love. Satan made Eve think she wasn\u2019t full when she already was. Satan deceives us into spending our life and identity trying to get what God has already given us for free. Life in Christ \u2013 it is about your being We contrasted: Life in Christ: Loved for who you are Life in the flesh: You think you are loved for what you do We get so addicted to our doing that we have a hard time imagining what it would be like to be loved for free \u2013 and ironically, all of our doing is what keeps us from experiencing the fact that we are loved for free. Getting worth from our actions In the flesh, you feel good about yourself by what you do - but your worth goes down when you don\u2019t do the right thing. You try to acquire worth. In Christ, all that we do should be about expressing who we already are. Life in Christ vs Life in the flesh The person living in the flesh may do the same things as the person in Christ, but they do it for different reasons. Life in Christ \u2013 Grace : Your worth is given as a gift. Life in Christ \u2013 Freedom : The freedom to love God as you are, love yourself as you are, and love others as they are. Life in Christ \u2013 Fullness : Getting your worth from God, not because of who you are is the only way to get full. Your soul can only be filled by His unconditional love. Living in the flesh is like eating a 7 course meal where all the food gets stuck in your teeth \u2013 it doesn\u2019t fill you. Life in Christ \u2013 Celebration : Celebrating who you already are. You can celebrate when you no longer need your environment to feed you. Life in Christ is real life Life in the flesh is dead. The only way we can give unconditional love to the world around us is if we are getting unconditional love (for free!) What determines whether you live in God\u2019s love is whether you believe the lie that you are not full. The truth is this: All you ever need is life in Jesus Christ \u2013 and if you are a Christian, you already have this life for free. Living out of our fullness The problem: We believe the lie (from Genesis 3) that God can\u2019t be counted on to make us full, so we believe the lie that we aren\u2019t actually full, so we believe the lie that we can actually do stuff to get full, so we spend our lives chasing the fullness, and that is the very thing that prevents us from experiencing the fullness that we already have! You don\u2019t enjoy your life because you are trying to get life. Just be. Let God be who He is, and you just be who you are. When we make mistakes There is a natural embarrassment when making a mistake that attaches to who you are. Our culture believes that your doing is your being \u2013 instead of doing the wrong thing, you are the wrong thing. When we discipline our children we need to make a clear distinction between what they did and who they are. Who they are is full of unconditional love and worth. Crack down on the behavior, but not who they are. They then become motivated out of a fullness to want to change the behavior instead of out of shame. Confront the lies in your life Expose the lies that try to define who you are \u2013 do this through prayer and invite Jesus into the place where those lies are and tell you the truth: that He loves you just as you are. Summary Just be . Be who you are in Jesus. Let go of the doing. God loves you unconditionally, which means He loves you no matter what you do. Celebrate that fact and live in that fact!

In preparing this recap, I feel it really goes along well with the Easter season. I really enjoyed our discussion on Sunday. I know the sermon clips were a bit shorter this time, but the discussion we had was great. My Background As I shared on Sunday, when I originally heard this sermon it really touched me because of my shallow relationship with God. I was nearly perfect on the outside, but as the sermon showed - the outward actions aren't what bring you closer to God. When we have an honest relationship with God, the outward actions are a result. I was using my knowledge of good and evil to dictate how I lived my life instead of living in a relationship with God. The knowledge of good and evil We heard in the sermon how when you live in that knowledge of good and evil, you constantly evaluate each situation to know how to respond: What would be the Christian thing to say, what would be the godly way to respond, what's the exact \"right\" prayer I should pray at this point, etc. Your life and your worth hang on your ability to perform \"correctly\". Technically, this type of behavior looks good and right, but there is a quality of life missing, a joy that is missing, a freedom that is missing when people live this way rather than out of a relationship with God. There was a story in the sermon that illustrated this perfectly (it was just way too long to include on Sunday). I will send the story next week. People who live this way (like I was) think that living religiously is the relationship with God, but it isn't. Because they are so wrapped up in correct behavior, when they don't exhibit correct behavior, they feel indicted, and compensate by minimizing their own sin, and trying to maximize the sins of the people around them. Because they get life from their system of right-ness, it looks like they have a relationship with God - but in fact, they are hiding behind a wall they create, which prevents them from actually having a good relationship with God. They hide, just like Adam and Eve did after eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. God loves you anyways We then heard how all of this type of behavior is a result of not trusting God. Not trusting that God is big enough to love you as you are . Not trusting that God truly loves the people around you. But what God wants us to see is the truth of He is, revealed in the cross of Jesus. God wants you because He is in love with you and Jesus died for you - not a perfect you, not a technically correct you, but the real you. No more performing Quit evaluating yourself and others - that's the curse of the forbidden tree. Get out of your performing and get into a relationship with God. Own up to who you are: You are guilty - but Jesus died for you as you are and wants to love you and heal you. Actually, you are even more guilty than you think you are, but He still loves you anyways. Plus, God knows you better than you know yourself: Do you think he doesn't know what you have done or how you are living? But Jesus dieing on the cross is a testimony of how much God loves you. Remember our study a couple of months ago about how much God loves you? He gave everything - he couldn't have given anything more - to show you how much He loves you. Honesty Will you trust God enough to be honest with Him? Give Him your heart - don't justify or excuse it - admit it because Jesus has already experienced every sin you have committed as He hung on the cross. He loves you anyways, and died for you just as you are . His mercy is far bigger than any of your sins. If you doubt this, let the nail marks in his hands and His pierced sides be proof to you. Let His cries of grief as he took your sin upon Himself be proof to you that His mercy is bigger than those sins. He is safe - be honest and real with Him. Once you do this, you can begin to discover the kind of love that God is and let Him change you from the inside out. Jesus as our defender We then heard the analogy of a defense lawyer. We are guilty of our sins, but Jesus is our defense lawyer 1 John 2:1-2 (NIV): My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father\u2014Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. Jesus, the defense lawyer, has never lost a case - every single person He represents is found to be innocent (Isaiah 1:18 NIV: \"Come now, let us settle the matter,\u201d says the Lord. \u201cThough your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.\") In fact, every person is not only found to be innocent, but also comes back as already \"serving the time\" for their actions - the punishment is already complete. 2 Corinthians 5:21 (NIV): God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. Jesus does this by being outrageously loving - he has a love relationship with you, the defendant. It turns out that Jesus is also the judge on the case. 2 Corinthians 5:10 (NIV): For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad. That is how He wins every case. The point of the analogy was not to relate Jesus to a legal trial, although it illustrates it well. The point is how much Jesus loves you. He doesn't want you to try to be something you are not. Go to Him as you are. Be honest with Him, and don't hide from Him like Adam and Eve did. Summary Once you \"give in\" to Him, you begin to discover your relationship with Him is not centered on what you are doing , but it is centered on your being . When you let God love you this way, you begin to be transformed from the inside out. You begin to do the right things out of God's love, not out of an obligation of how you are \"supposed\" to act. It's all about the infinite love of God toward you - the infinite worth God ascribes to you. Live in that - get your life from that. Stop getting your life from behaving the \"right\" way. I'll leave with a quote from one of the clips we heard: Jesus died on the cursed tree to free you from the curse of the forbidden tree.

Brief Summary Smaller groups of community are vital for a believer to grow in Christ. Since we live in a worldly culture, we need to be a part of a smaller sub-culture with role models and people who are committed to living counter-culturally with us. What does this have to do with love and judgment? First: If a person has not invited you into their life to be committed to help them live a kingdom-focused life, your only opinion of them is that they were worth Jesus dying for. Second: Discernment is a good type of judgment and is only to be exercised when you are in an agreed relationship with someone where you pledge to help each other live Godly lives. That was my \u201cbrief\u201d summary. For more details, see the rest of this email. Summary of previous 7 weeks You can have right beliefs, supernatural faith, great deeds, etc. \u2013 but if it is not motivated by Christ-like love, it is worthless ( 1 Corinthians 13:1-3 ) The main obstacle to Christ-like love is the original sin of the Bible: eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. This knowledge brings about judgment and blocks us from being the people God wants us to be. Only God can judge perfectly and love perfectly \u2013 we can\u2019t. Judgment is about ascribing worth to ourselves at cost to others. Love is about ascribing worth to others at cost to ourselves. We should only have one opinion of others : They were worth Jesus dying for. A good kind of judgment The word Krino in Greek means to separate or distinguish. Bad judgment separates people, but good judgment usually separates things. Hebrews 5:14 : But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil. This kind of distinguishing or discernment is needed in the body of Christ \u2013 we can\u2019t grow effectively in Christ without relationships with people who help us discern the good and bad things in our lives. 1 Corinthians 5:12 What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? In the church where people have committed to live like the bride of Christ, there needs to be discernment \u2013 relationships with other people that help us determine what is helping and what is hindering our walks with God. The context of the early church The early church was made up of small groups of people that met on a very regular basis, usually in each others homes. Today\u2019s churches usually meet in a big building where many people aren\u2019t in a deep relationship with each other. It takes an agreement between people and a lot of investment to be committed to help each other discern. Judging a stranger We may see behavior in a stranger (Christian or non-Christian) that we don\u2019t agree with \u2013 but how do we know that is what God wants that person to be working on in their life? In many of these cases you can do more harm than good by imposing your perceptions on the life of someone you know little about. We need discerning believers in our lives We are social creatures, which means we will usually conform to the larger social environment that we are a part of. That is why we need to be a part of a smaller sub-culture with role models and people who are committed to living counter-culturally with you. We all have blind spots \u2013 it is very hard to accurately monitor yourself. If we are serious about living a distinct Kingdom life, we need to have input from other believers in our life. Individualism and Tolerance The founding ideals of America are all about the individual \u2013 the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This is almost opposite of the values of the Kingdom of God. The kingdom of God begins when you die to your right of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. America is a great place to live \u2013 this isn\u2019t saying America has it all wrong. This is saying that the American values do not align with Kingdom values. Part of living Kingdom lives is to be in strong relationships with others \u2013 where we need to die to tolerance and individualism (within the context of that relationship). Practical application What relationships do you have where you can enter into a discerning relationship and choose to live counter-cultural, Kingdom-focused lives? When it comes to strangers \u2013 you are allowed one opinion: God loves that person and died for them. When it comes to people with whom you are committed to living a kingdom life, we need to help each other grow. We still ascribe God\u2019s love and worth to them, but the relationship needs to go beyond that to where you help each other grow and develop in God. It also goes both ways: Not only do you need someone in your life to keep you Kingdom focused, but other believers around you might need your input in their lives so that they can grow! Thankful! I mentioned this on Sunday, but I just want to re-iterate how thankful I am for this small group \u2013 this sermon we listened to just increased my passion for growing together in this group. I pray that we would grow deeper in our relationships with each other and God and become a group that \u201chas each others' backs\u201d, encourages each other, and impacts the world around us.

It also goes both ways: Not only do you need someone in your life to keep you Kingdom focused, but other believers around you might need your input in their lives so that they can grow!","title":"Practical application"},{"location":"love2014/love8/#thankful","text":"I mentioned this on Sunday, but I just want to re-iterate how thankful I am for this small group \u2013 this sermon we listened to just increased my passion for growing together in this group.

Next time we meet we will have a question/answer time - I have some Q&A sessions from the sermon series we covered and we also thought it would be neat if we came up with some questions and try to answer them as a group. We will send more info on that later. The theme of the sermon that we listened to on Sunday was basically that love is a choice and is not tied to our emotions. A reminder We started out with the reminder that everyone has infinite value to God. God is love (I John 4:8) and he created us out of that love, in order to have a love relationship with us. When we interact with people, we need to remember that God created them out of love too! A description of love We also heard a really good description of love: Love is not doing what makes you feel good, it is doing what is good in spite of how you feel. Love listens to your feelings but then involves a choice from your heart. Compelled by love In 2 Corinthians 5:14-15, it says that Christ's love compels us. This doesn't mean that God's love forces us to walk around loving everyone. It means that God's amazing love should be the driving force behind our actions. An analogy Then we heard an analogy that gave a good example of how love is a choice. We compared our emotions to a thermometer where they go up and down with the environment around us. Our emotions are not bad, and we should listen to our emotions to help us make good choices. But we cannot command our emotions (we can command our choices) - Just like a thermometer cannot command the temperature to go up or down. Love, and our choice to love, is like a thermostat. A thermostat chooses to set the temperature. It works with the furnace to raise the temperature in a room/building. This is like our choice to love: it is a choice to work with God to raise the \"temperature\" of love in our environment around us. We need to make the choice to work with God to be counter-cultural by loving those around us, even if the world says they don't deserve it. Choosing to love God calls us to love because God is love. This seems difficult, because how can a person feel love all the time? This is where choice comes in: We can choose love regardless of how we feel. We talked about how it is not about faking it. We can truly be hurt by a person, and yet choose to respond in a way that is consistent with God's love. We don't need to condone someone's behavior, but we are commanded to make the choice to love them anyways. (Like Jesus told the early Christians to love their enemies - at that period in time, the enemies of the Christians would burn them alive and many other cruel things). Summary Doing everything in love is the greatest commandment that we receive from Jesus. It is also one of the most difficult. Commanding our choices is essential to loving others, and we shouldn't let our emotions decide our choices. Our emotions can play a part and give us information on a situation, but we should always reflect what our intellect and faith tell us to do as well. In this way, we can choose to clothe ourselves in love. Have a blessed week!","title":"Love 9 - Let Love Lead"},{"location":"love2014/love9/#love-9","text":"5/6/2014 I mentioned on Sunday that we were covering the last of the sermons in the series.

But you do not listen! \u201cViolence is everywhere!\u201d I cry, but you do not come to save. Must I forever see these evil deeds? Why must I watch all this misery? Wherever I look, I see destruction and violence. I am surrounded by people who love to argue and fight. This is very 2019 - destruction, violence, people who argue and fight Hebrews 9:27-28 And just as each person is destined to die once and after that comes judgment, so also Christ was offered once for all time as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people. He will come again, not to deal with our sins, but to bring salvation to all who are eagerly waiting for him. Thank goodness for verse 28 because verse 27 would be pretty awful by itself Matthew 3:7-8 But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to watch him baptize, he denounced them. \u201cYou brood of snakes!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWho warned you to flee the coming wrath? Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God. The importance of living your faith (walk the walk, not just talk the talk) 2 Peter 1:19 Because of that experience, we have even greater confidence in the message proclaimed by the prophets. You must pay close attention to what they wrote, for their words are like a lamp shining in a dark place\u2014until the Day dawns, and Christ the Morning Star shines in your hearts. What an amazing visual and reminder to read the Bible and pay attention to it Luke 14:26 \u201cIf you want to be my disciple, you must, by comparison, hate everyone else\u2014your father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters\u2014yes, even your own life. Otherwise, you cannot be my disciple. Hyperbole since Jesus told us to love everyone, even our enemies. I think this means our allegiance to Christ is to never compete with our allegiance to anyone or anything else. 2 Corinthians 4:18 So we don\u2019t look at the troubles we can see now; rather, we fix our gaze on things that cannot be seen. For the things we see now will soon be gone, but the things we cannot see will last forever. Fix our gaze on things that cannot be seen So important to remember that many of the things we \"love\" will soon be gone 1 Peter 1:4 and we have a priceless inheritance\u2014an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay. Important to remember that the things we do here that have eternal value can never be corrupted Titus 1:2 This truth gives them confidence that they have eternal life, which God\u2014who does not lie\u2014promised them before the world began. What an amazing verse to cling to Isaiah 25:8 He will swallow up death forever! The Sovereign Lord will wipe away all tears. He will remove forever all insults and mockery against his land and people. The Lord has spoken! This is indeed something worth leaving everything else behind Revelation 21:6 And he also said, \u201cIt is finished! I am the Alpha and the Omega\u2014the Beginning and the End. To all who are thirsty I will give freely from the springs of the water of life. Freely Psalm 40:2 He lifted me out of the pit of despair, out of the mud and the mire. He set my feet on solid ground and steadied me as I walked along. The book really helped visualize this verse From the book, slough of despond is a place where sinners become aware of their sins - so true! 1 Corinthians 7:29 But let me say this, dear brothers and sisters: The time that remains is very short. So from now on, those with wives should not focus only on their marriage. A reminder to work towards things that will have everlasting value (which can include a marriage) Interesting: Christian said he didn't have his burden until he read the book. I'm sure it can seem like that sometimes. The gulit and pain Christian experienced when Evangelism met him when he was trying to take the easy way - ouch Matthew 7:13-14 \u201cYou can enter God\u2019s Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way. But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it. The road is difficult Only a few ever find it. I wonder if this is talking about salvation, or does it actually mean few in which case is the verse talking about people who become so close to Jesus that they become like him? Galatians 3:10 But those who depend on the law to make them right with God are under his curse, for the Scriptures say, \u201cCursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the commands that are written in God\u2019s Book of the Law.\u201d Trying to follow a law with the intentions of being right only becomes a curse... From the book: \"Your sin is great\". This chapter was a great reminder of the gravity of our sins. It makes it that much more sweeter to think of what Jesus did for us on the cross. Some thoughts Other verses I am reminded of: John 3:16 \u201cFor this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.\" Romans 3:23 \"For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God\u2019s glorious standard.\" 1 John 1:9 \"But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.\" God\u2019s Word, the Bible, convicts people of their sin. God\u2019s Word is the light that shows sinners to the narrow gate which is Jesus When we confess our sin and trust in Jesus, he forgives us and gives us life that lasts forever.","title":"Stage 1"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage1/#pilgrims-progress","text":"","title":"Pilgrim's Progress"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage1/#stage-1","text":"","title":"Stage 1"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage1/#summary","text":"Author's Apology for his Book Christian's deplorable condition Evangelist directs him Obstinate and Pliable Slough of Despond Worldly Wiseman Mount Sinai Conversation with Evangelist","title":"Summary"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage1/#notes","text":"Psalm 38:4 \"My guilt overwhelms me \u2014 it is a burden too heavy to bear.\" Can relate to this feeling Habakkuk 1:2-3 How long, O Lord, must I call for help?

Revelation 21:18 The wall was made of jasper, and the city was pure gold, as clear as glass. beautiful! 1 Corinthians 13:12 Now we see things imperfectly, like puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we will see everything with perfect clarity. All that I know now is partial and incomplete, but then I will know everything completely, just as God now knows me completely.

When you walk through the fire of oppression, you will not be burned up; the flames will not consume you.

You have come to the assembly of God\u2019s firstborn children, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God himself, who is the judge over all things. You have come to the spirits of the righteous ones in heaven who have now been made perfect. You have come to Jesus, the one who mediates the new covenant between God and people, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks of forgiveness instead of crying out for vengeance like the blood of Abel. You have come to God himself - that is heaven! Revelation 2:7 \u201cAnyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches.

Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that sinful nature. But those who live to please the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit. The importance of cultivating our faith on this earth 1 John 3:2 Dear friends, we are already God\u2019s children, but he has not yet shown us what we will be like when Christ appears. But we do know that we will be like him, for we will see him as he really is. Implies that we cannot see him as he really is right now. 1 Corinthians 6:2-3 Don\u2019t you realize that someday we believers will judge the world? And since you are going to judge the world, can\u2019t you decide even these little things among yourselves? Don\u2019t you realize that we will judge angels? So you should surely be able to resolve ordinary disputes in this life. Interesting verse. The Corinthians were taking each other to court and Paul was shaking his head at them and wrote this verse. I don't think he is saying this as a thing to look forward to - just a fact that all will be judged. We don't really know what that judging will look like though. Revelation 19:9 And the angel said to me, \u201cWrite this: Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb.\u201d And he added, \u201cThese are true words that come from God.\u201d What a blessing!

And since you are going to judge the world, can\u2019t you decide even these little things among yourselves? Don\u2019t you realize that we will judge angels? So you should surely be able to resolve ordinary disputes in this life. Interesting verse. The Corinthians were taking each other to court and Paul was shaking his head at them and wrote this verse. I don't think he is saying this as a thing to look forward to - just a fact that all will be judged. We don't really know what that judging will look like though.

But when I learned the command not to covet, for instance, the power of sin came to life, The law chokes, the gospel frees 1 Corinthians 15:56 For sin is the sting that results in death, and the law gives sin its power. Wow - the law gives sin its power! Romans 5:20 God\u2019s law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were. But as people sinned more and more, God\u2019s wonderful grace became more abundant. What a beautiful verse - to be set free from rules! Romans 16:25-26 Now all glory to God, who is able to make you strong, just as my Good News says. This message about Jesus Christ has revealed his plan for you Gentiles, a plan kept secret from the beginning of time.

But since they don\u2019t have deep roots, they believe for a while, then they fall away when they face temptation. The importance of having roots Hebrews 6:4-6 For it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened\u2014those who have experienced the good things of heaven and shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the power of the age to come\u2014 and who then turn away from God. It is impossible to bring such people back to repentance; by rejecting the Son of God, they themselves are nailing him to the cross once again and holding him up to public shame. It sounds so brutal, but upon thinking about it, how would you convince someone who has tasted the goodness and walked away to come back to God? Luke 19:14 But his people hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, \u2018We do not want him to be our king.\u2019 Hebrews 10:29 Just think how much worse the punishment will be for those who have trampled on the Son of God, and have treated the blood of the covenant, which made us holy, as if it were common and unholy, and have insulted and disdained the Holy Spirit who brings God\u2019s mercy to us. Yikes... The Dream of Judgment John 5:28-29 Don\u2019t be so surprised! Indeed, the time is coming when all the dead in their graves will hear the voice of God\u2019s Son, and they will rise again.

The Day of Judgement is a filter - the empty deeds that we pursued in our lives will be burned up. I don't think this is saying that this is where people will be burned up, but instead where anything in our lives that doesn't align with God will be burned. Luke 3:17 He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork.

They will look on me whom they have pierced and mourn for him as for an only son. They will grieve bitterly for him as for a firstborn son who has died. Is the \"him\" speaking of Jesus? I love the \"pour out a spirit of grace and prayer\" Isaiah 53:5 But he was pierced for our rebellion, crushed for our sins. He was beaten so we could be whole. He was whipped so we could be healed. Beaten so we could be whole. Whipped so we could be healed. I love the NLT translation here. The Message translation here is very powerful. \"All the things wrong with us \" Zechariah 3:4 So the angel said to the others standing there, \u201cTake off his filthy clothes.\u201d And turning to Jeshua he said, \u201cSee, I have taken away your sins, and now I am giving you these fine new clothes.\u201d Such an important reminder. I think it's easy to view ourselves dirty but still redeemed. We need to remember that we are no longer dirty! Ephesians 1:13 And now you Gentiles have also heard the truth, the Good News that God saves you. And when you believed in Christ, he identified you as his own by giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long ago. \"He identified you as his own\" \"Gave you the Holy Spirit\" Notes on the scroll From this page This morning I asked my girls, \"What is the scroll?\" 11 yr old bubbled over with the following explanation. She talked fast, I tried to write it down word for word. I asked her to repeat it again a few times and so to the best of my ability below is what she said. Read it fast, excitedly and with a happy ring to it and you will recapture our conversation this morning. \"The scroll is the call of God in your life, as you sense that and look at that then the wonders of God's word are opened up to you, and they amaze you and excite you, and make you so happy that you run faster for heaven. And each time you look into that call of God in your life his word is speaking to you, and you are being thrilled so that you should do this often for refreshment. But if you are lazy, slothful, and sinning you can lose that sense of the call of God in your life. It becomes dull to you, you look and it's not there because of sin. So you need to go back in your thoughts to the place where you lost it and through all that laziness and sloth and sin, repenting of it, sorry for it and find again God's call in your life. And once more have the wonders of God's word opened up to you and making you happy and excited so that you run fast for heaven again.\" * See Ephesians 4:30 And do not bring sorrow to God\u2019s Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he has identified you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption. Simple, Sloth, Presumption, Formalist, Hypocrisy Proverbs 23:34 You will stagger like a sailor tossed at sea, clinging to a swaying mast. Skimmed over this at first but the more I thought about it the more it made sense. How hopeless and pointless it is to be complacent about our faith! 1 Peter 5:8 Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. If the devil was literally a lion chasing us, how much more fervent would we be in following Jesus? I could argue that the reality is even more important... John 10:1 \u201cI tell you the truth, anyone who sneaks over the wall of a sheepfold, rather than going through the gate, must surely be a thief and a robber! I suppose this is more like talking the talk and not walking the walk? The analogy is a little weird though because they (formality and hypocrisy) are walking on the narrow path - but I guess I would say they are just going through the motions. Galatians 2:16 Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law.\u201d So counterintuitive sometimes - but it is so compelling to want to follow rules to be right - but \"no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law\" Hill of Difficulty Isaiah 49:10 They will neither hunger nor thirst. The searing sun will not reach them anymore. For the Lord in his mercy will lead them; he will lead them beside cool waters. This is hard to remember or picture, but I guess is it comforting to remember. Proverbs 6:6 Take a lesson from the ants, you lazybones. Learn from their ways and become wise! Sleep in the Daytime Timorous and Mistrust Misses his scroll 1 Thessalonians 5:6-8 So be on your guard, not asleep like the others. Stay alert and be clearheaded. Night is the time when people sleep and drinkers get drunk. But let us who live in the light be clearheaded, protected by the armor of faith and love, and wearing as our helmet the confidence of our salvation. Christian compared it to Israel wandering in the desert What a waste of time to be lazy The palace Beautiful The lions Mark 4:40 Then he asked them, \u201cWhy are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?\u201d So many circumstances where it feels like our world is falling a part. We can't see the lions chains so we assume we will be destroyed. When a circumstance seems so impossible it feels like nothing can save it, but having faith that God can work it out for good should give us courage to go on. Having faith when people I love get divorced... Talk with Discretion, Piety, Prudence, and Charity Genesis 9:27 May God expand the territory of Japheth! May Japheth share the prosperity of Shem, and may Canaan be his servant.\u201d Hebrews 11:15-16 If they had longed for the country they came from, they could have gone back. But they were looking for a better place, a heavenly homeland. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. Do you ever think about \"going back\"? To just throw everything away and live your own life? The people I have seen do this always look so sad and lonely Romans 7:15, 21 I don\u2019t really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don\u2019t do it. Instead, I do what I hate. Classic. Why do we do the things we know we shouldn't? You would think we'd be able to stop... The book says to meditate on the cross Revelation 21:4 He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain. All these things are gone forever.\u201d forever - we need to remember that. Genesis 19:14 So Lot rushed out to tell his daughters\u2019 fianc\u00e9s, \u201cQuick, get out of the city! The Lord is about to destroy it.\u201d But the young men thought he was only joking. In the end, you cannot force your loved ones to follow Jesus - they have to decide. 1 John 3:12 We must not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because Cain had been doing what was evil, and his brother had been doing what was righteous. Ezekiel 3:19 If you warn them and they refuse to repent and keep on sinning, they will die in their sins. But you will have saved yourself because you obeyed me. In the end we need to make sure we are living pure lives before Jesus. Being consumed by someone who won't decide to follow Jesus will drag you down. About the Lord of the Hill Hebrews 2:14-15 Because God\u2019s children are human beings\u2014made of flesh and blood\u2014the Son also became flesh and blood. For only as a human being could he die, and only by dying could he break the power of the devil, who had the power of death. Only in this way could he set free all who have lived their lives as slaves to the fear of dying. This makes us love him even more! 1 Samuel 2:8 He lifts the poor from the dust and the needy from the garbage dump. He sets them among princes, placing them in seats of honor. For all the earth is the Lord\u2019s, and he has set the world in order. Wonders shown to Christian Hebrews 11:33-34 By faith these people overthrew kingdoms, ruled with justice, and received what God had promised them. They shut the mouths of lions, quenched the flames of fire, and escaped death by the edge of the sword. Their weakness was turned to strength. They became strong in battle and put whole armies to flight. What a strong background of our faith - this should bring encouragement to us! The great cloud of witnesses that went before us. Isaiah 33:16-17 these are the ones who will dwell on high. The rocks of the mountains will be their fortress. Food will be supplied to them, and they will have water in abundance. Your eyes will see the king in all his splendor, and you will see a land that stretches into the distance. Keep our eyes fixed on heaven - that should give encouragement to press on.","title":"Stage 3"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage3/#pilgrims-progress","text":"","title":"Pilgrim's Progress"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage3/#stage-3","text":"","title":"Stage 3"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage3/#summary","text":"Loses his burden at the Cross Simple, Sloth, Presumption, Formalist, Hypocrisy Hill of Difficulty Timorous and Mistrust Sleep in the Daytime Misses his scroll The palace Beautiful The lions Talk with Discretion, Piety, Prudence, and Charity About the Lord of the Hill Wonders shown to Christian","title":"Summary"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage3/#notes","text":"","title":"Notes"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage3/#loses-his-burden-at-the-cross","text":"https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/at-what-point-in-pilgrims-progress-does-christian-get-saved/ The burden represents psychological guilt not forensic guilt.

I love the \"pour out a spirit of grace and prayer\" Isaiah 53:5 But he was pierced for our rebellion, crushed for our sins. He was beaten so we could be whole. He was whipped so we could be healed. Beaten so we could be whole. Whipped so we could be healed. I love the NLT translation here. The Message translation here is very powerful. \"All the things wrong with us \" Zechariah 3:4 So the angel said to the others standing there, \u201cTake off his filthy clothes.\u201d And turning to Jeshua he said, \u201cSee, I have taken away your sins, and now I am giving you these fine new clothes.\u201d Such an important reminder. I think it's easy to view ourselves dirty but still redeemed. We need to remember that we are no longer dirty! Ephesians 1:13 And now you Gentiles have also heard the truth, the Good News that God saves you. And when you believed in Christ, he identified you as his own by giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long ago. \"He identified you as his own\" \"Gave you the Holy Spirit\" Notes on the scroll From this page This morning I asked my girls, \"What is the scroll?\" 11 yr old bubbled over with the following explanation. She talked fast, I tried to write it down word for word. I asked her to repeat it again a few times and so to the best of my ability below is what she said. Read it fast, excitedly and with a happy ring to it and you will recapture our conversation this morning. \"The scroll is the call of God in your life, as you sense that and look at that then the wonders of God's word are opened up to you, and they amaze you and excite you, and make you so happy that you run faster for heaven. And each time you look into that call of God in your life his word is speaking to you, and you are being thrilled so that you should do this often for refreshment. But if you are lazy, slothful, and sinning you can lose that sense of the call of God in your life. It becomes dull to you, you look and it's not there because of sin. So you need to go back in your thoughts to the place where you lost it and through all that laziness and sloth and sin, repenting of it, sorry for it and find again God's call in your life. And once more have the wonders of God's word opened up to you and making you happy and excited so that you run fast for heaven again.\" * See Ephesians 4:30 And do not bring sorrow to God\u2019s Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he has identified you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption.","title":"Loses his burden at the Cross"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage3/#simple-sloth-presumption-formalist-hypocrisy","text":"Proverbs 23:34 You will stagger like a sailor tossed at sea, clinging to a swaying mast.

Hearing and saying isn't what makes up a good christian Matthew 13:23 The seed that fell on good soil represents those who truly hear and understand God\u2019s word and produce a harvest of thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!\u201d Matthew 13:30 Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the harvesters to sort out the weeds, tie them into bundles, and burn them, and to put the wheat in the barn.\u2019\u201d Deuteronomy 14:7-10 but if the animal doesn\u2019t have both, it may not be eaten. So you may not eat the camel, the hare, or the hyrax. They chew the cud but do not have split hooves, so they are ceremonially unclean for you. And you may not eat the pig. It has split hooves but does not chew the cud, so it is ceremonially unclean for you. You may not eat the meat of these animals or even touch their carcasses. \u201cOf all the marine animals, you may eat whatever has both fins and scales. You may not, however, eat marine animals that do not have both fins and scales. They are ceremonially unclean for you. 1 Corinthians 13:1 If I could speak all the languages of earth and of angels, but didn\u2019t love others, I would only be a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 1 Corinthians 14:7 Even lifeless instruments like the flute or the harp must play the notes clearly, or no one will recognize the melody. Genesis 39:15 When he heard me scream, he ran outside and got away, but he left his cloak behind with me.\u201d * 1 Corinthians 13:2 If I had the gift of prophecy, and if I understood all of God\u2019s secret plans and possessed all knowledge, and if I had such faith that I could move mountains, but didn\u2019t love others, I would be nothing. Psalms 119:34 Give me understanding and I will obey your instructions; I will put them into practice with all my heart. Psalms 38:18 But I confess my sins; I am deeply sorry for what I have done. Galatians 2:15, 16 \u201cYou and I are Jews by birth, not \u2018sinners\u2019 like the Gentiles. 2 Corinthians 6:17 Therefore, come out from among unbelievers, and separate yourselves from them, says the Lord.

He still gave a defense for himself, but he did not \"fight\" back. By-ends and his friends Proverbs 26:25 They pretend to be kind, but don\u2019t believe them. Their hearts are full of many evils. The importance of having discernment from God By-ends held onto his religion and told Christian he could never let go of it By-ends and his friends thought they were going on a pilgrimige as well. Hold-the-world's favorite part of his religion was God's blessings John 6:26 Jesus replied, \u201cI tell you the truth, you want to be with me because I fed you, not because you understood the miraculous signs. Being made complete and having the hole inside our heart always filled is what draws us to God. Genesis 34:20-24 and he went with his father, Hamor, to present this proposal to the leaders at the town gate. \u201cThese men are our friends,\u201d they said. \u201cLet\u2019s invite them to live here among us and trade freely. Look, the land is large enough to hold them. We can take their daughters as wives and let them marry ours. But they will consider staying here and becoming one people with us only if all of our men are circumcised, just as they are. But if we do this, all their livestock and possessions will eventually be ours. Come, let\u2019s agree to their terms and let them settle here among us.\u201d So all the men in the town council agreed with Hamor and Shechem, and every male in the town was circumcised. If a church's goal is to bring people in so that the church can have more (money), that is obviously the wrong desire. The cart before the horse - instead people being drawn in by love and being made complete in God's love in turn will become generous and the church will \"prosper\". Luke 20:46-47 \u201cBeware of these teachers of religious law! For they like to parade around in flowing robes and love to receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces. And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the head table at banquets. Yet they shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public. Because of this, they will be severely punished.\u201d The danger of using religion for your own benefits John 12:6 Not that he cared for the poor\u2014he was a thief, and since he was in charge of the disciples\u2019 money, he often stole some for himself. That would be hard to balance - I'd have a hard time being a pastor and taking a salary (not saying they shouldn't) - it would be difficult to work through. Acts 8:19-22 \u201cLet me have this power, too,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cso that when I lay my hands on people, they will receive the Holy Spirit!\u201d But Peter replied, \u201cMay your money be destroyed with you for thinking God\u2019s gift can be bought! You can have no part in this, for your heart is not right with God. Repent of your wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive your evil thoughts, Thinking God's gift can be bought... Money-love's description of pastors and churches: The draw for bigger congregations and more money to grow even more He reasoned that a bigger congregation would help him be a better pastor Plain of Ease Interesting how quickly they passed through the Plain of Ease - if our time in the Plain of Ease was long, how faithful would we be to God? Lucre-hill, Demas, and the Silver Mine Lucre: Money, especially when regarded as distasteful or gained in a dishonorable way. 1 Timothy 6:9 But people who long to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction. Interesting how Christian had learned from his previous mistakes of being led astray while Hopeful was willing to look. 2 Timothy 4:10 Demas has deserted me because he loves the things of this life and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus has gone to Dalmatia. Demas was one of Paul's fellow-workers who abandoned him in his time of need. Matthew 27:3-5 When Judas, who had betrayed him, realized that Jesus had been condemned to die, he was filled with remorse. So he took the thirty pieces of silver back to the leading priests and the elders. \u201cI have sinned,\u201d he declared, \u201cfor I have betrayed an innocent man.\u201d \u201cWhat do we care?\u201d they retorted. \u201cThat\u2019s your problem.\u201d Then Judas threw the silver coins down in the Temple and went out and hanged himself. The draw of the world and its weath brought Judas to his destruction Important to remember where are treasure really is and what really matters Genesis 19:26 But Lot\u2019s wife looked back as she was following behind him, and she turned into a pillar of salt. A good reminder of the draw of the world and the pull to sin. Numbers 16:31-32 He had hardly finished speaking the words when the ground suddenly split open beneath them. The earth opened its mouth and swallowed the men, along with their households and all their followers who were standing with them, and everything they owned. Also good to remember that sin has consequences (not necessarily direct punishment from God but natural consequences) Genesis 13:10-13 Lot took a long look at the fertile plains of the Jordan Valley in the direction of Zoar. The whole area was well watered everywhere, like the garden of the Lord or the beautiful land of Egypt. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) Lot chose for himself the whole Jordan Valley to the east of them. He went there with his flocks and servants and parted company with his uncle Abram. So Abram settled in the land of Canaan, and Lot moved his tents to a place near Sodom and settled among the cities of the plain. But the people of this area were extremely wicked and constantly sinned against the Lord. Lot \"flirted\" with the world and eventually became impacted by his decisions The River of Life and Vain-Confidence Revelation 22:1 Then the angel showed me a river with the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb. The deep beauty of God's provisions. Psalms 23:2 He lets me rest in green meadows; he leads me beside peaceful streams. A reminder of how God provides for us and shelters us Numbers 21:4 Then the people of Israel set out from Mount Hor, taking the road to the Red Sea to go around the land of Edom. But the people grew impatient with the long journey, And a reminder of how quickly we can forget God's provisions Proverbs 28:26 Those who trust their own insight are foolish, but anyone who walks in wisdom is safe. Vain-Confidence wasn't purposely trying to mislead them - but it shows the importance of testing what we hear against the Bible. Jeremiah 31:21 Set up road signs; put up guideposts. Mark well the path by which you came. Come back again, my virgin Israel; return to your towns here. The importance of teaching others, but also paying attention to what we have been taught. Doubting Castle and Giant Despair Diffidence: The opposite of confidence Christian and Hopeful tried \"with all the skill they had\" to return to the Way but were instead overcome by doubt and despair The despair of wandering astray yet one more time - and bringing a brother with him Psalms 88:18 You have taken away my companions and loved ones. Darkness is my closest friend. The result of taking their eyes away from Jesus Christian and Hopeful ended up in Doubting Castle because they were no longer looking to Christ and resting in His provision. They had looked to themselves to find an easier path. And even when they realized their error and sought to return to the Way, they failed, striving in their own efforts. \"All the skill they had\" was not sufficient to revive and restore them. Job 7:15 I would rather be strangled\u2014 rather die than suffer like this. Utter despair Despair beats us without mercy and leaves us feeling utterly hopeless. Despair goes hand-in-hand with doubt - It causes us to question what we know to be true. It isolates us and casts suspicion over hope/joy. But then Hopeful reminds us of who God is and what God has said - he was working to set their eyes back on Jesus. The blessing of having friends to strengthen us in times of despair Just when you think it might get better Giant Despair comes back and tells them they are going to wish they were never born Hopefull reminds Christian God protecting him from Apollyon Yet again, things seem better but Despair shows them all of the other pilgrims he has destroyed Despair is relentless Important to remember Romans 5:3\u20135 \" And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope. Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us \" Very interesting how strong Despair was in the dark but weak in the light The Key of Promise Led me to 2 Peter 1:2\u20134 : May God give you more and more grace and peace as you grow in your knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord. By his divine power, God has given us everything we need for living a godly life. We have received all of this by coming to know him, the one who called us to himself by means of his marvelous glory and excellence. And because of his glory and excellence, he has given us great and precious promises. These are the promises that enable you to share his divine nature and escape the world\u2019s corruption caused by human desires. Escape the world's corruption - The Key of God's Promises help us escape the world! Despair and doubt caused him to forget God's promises When doubt enters and Jesus is not in our view, we can have the hardest time believing that someone like us can be saved. Even when we take hold of the Key, the Lock can be stubborn - but the promise of the gospel will indeed open it. Also reminded me of when Christian saw the man in the cage at Interpreters house - he was imprisoned because he could not imagine being free In the end, it was God's promises that freed them from doubt and despair. Our friends cannot free us (although they can remind us of God's promises) Searching for a way of escape is trying to do it on our own strength (although in the searching we could discover God's promises that we forgot)","title":"Stage 7"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage7/#pilgrims-progress","text":"","title":"Pilgrim's Progress"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage7/#stage-7","text":"","title":"Stage 7"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage7/#summary","text":"Christian meets Hopeful By-ends and his friends Plain of Ease Lucre-hill, Demas, and the Silver Mine The River of Life and Vain-Confidence Doubting Castle and Giant Despair The Key of Promise","title":"Summary"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage7/#notes","text":"","title":"Notes"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage7/#christian-meets-hopeful","text":"Faithful's humility and meekness was a witness to Hopeful.

The danger of thinking you know everything - rather than being willing to admit you don't know everything Ecclesiastes 10:3 You can identify fools just by the way they walk down the street! It is pretty easy to identify someone who doesn't live a wise life Turn-away Matthew 12:45 \u201cWhen an evil spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, seeking rest but finding none. 44 Then it says, \u2018I will return to the person I came from.\u2019 So it returns and finds its former home empty, swept, and in order. 45 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before. That will be the experience of this evil generation.\u201d Turn-away represents those who have fallen away from the faith. Though they once professed to be followers of Christ, now they have turned away. They grow careless and trifle with sin to the point where it no longer disturbs them. The grow comfortable with the world. They fail to fear God and are unaffected and unrestrained by His Word. They forsake Christ only to be ensnared in sin. Hebrews 6:4-6 For it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened\u2014those who have experienced the good things of heaven and shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the power of the age to come \u2014 and who then turn away from God. It is impossible to bring such people back to repentance; by rejecting the Son of God, they themselves are nailing him to the cross once again and holding him up to public shame. Hebrews makes it clear in verse 6 why it is impossible for those who reject the cross to be renewed to repentance. If the cross was indeed not sufficient for them; they would need Jesus to die again. Little-Faith Little-faith represents those who are weak in faith and spiritually unprepared to face the trials and temptations of this world. He follows Christ, but lacks courage, confidence and comfort. 1 Peter 4:18 And also, \u201cIf the righteous are barely saved, what will happen to godless sinners?\u201d 2 Peter 2:9 So you see, the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their trials, even while keeping the wicked under punishment until the day of final judgment. Genesis 25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew. Esau ate the meal, then got up and left. He showed contempt for his rights as the firstborn. Genesis 25:32 \u201cLook, I\u2019m dying of starvation!\u201d said Esau. \u201cWhat good is my birthright to me now?\u201d Jeremiah 2:24 You are like a wild donkey, sniffing the wind at mating time. Who can restrain her lust? Those who desire her don\u2019t need to search, for she goes running to them! The power of temptation - we seek out our sin 1 Peter 5:8 Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. The importance of being on guard against sin and temptation Psalms 88:1-3 O Lord, God of my salvation, I cry out to you by day. I come to you at night. Now hear my prayer; listen to my cry. For my life is full of troubles, and death draws near. Job 41:26-29 No sword can stop it, no spear, dart, or javelin. Iron is nothing but straw to that creature, and bronze is like rotten wood. Arrows cannot make it flee. Stones shot from a sling are like bits of grass. Clubs are like a blade of grass, and it laughs at the swish of javelins. Job 39:19-25 \u201cHave you given the horse its strength or clothed its neck with a flowing mane? Did you give it the ability to leap like a locust? Its majestic snorting is terrifying! It paws the earth and rejoices in its strength when it charges out to battle. It laughs at fear and is unafraid. It does not run from the sword. The arrows rattle against it, and the spear and javelin flash. It paws the ground fiercely and rushes forward into battle when the ram\u2019s horn blows. It snorts at the sound of the horn. It senses the battle in the distance. It quivers at the captain\u2019s commands and the noise of battle. Ephesians 6:16 In addition to all of these, hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery arrows of the devil. Exodus 33:15 Then Moses said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t personally go with us, don\u2019t make us leave this place. Psalms 3:5-6 I lay down and slept, yet I woke up in safety, for the Lord was watching over me. I am not afraid of ten thousand enemies who surround me on every side. Isaiah 10:4 You will stumble along as prisoners or lie among the dead. But even then the Lord\u2019s anger will not be satisfied. His fist is still poised to strike. The Flatterer and the shining one Flattery is deceitful and insincere. It is darkness masquerading as light. It is a lie parading itself as truth. It coaxes us to think well of ourselves. It assures us that our sins are not as bad as they really are. Proverbs 29:5 To flatter friends is to lay a trap for their feet. Psalms 17:4 I have followed your commands, which keep me from following cruel and evil people. Follow God's word 2 Corinthians 11:13-14 These people are false apostles. They are deceitful workers who disguise themselves as apostles of Christ. But I am not surprised! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. How crafty the devil is. It is so important to us to be familiar with God's word and His voice. Romans 16:17-18 And now I make one more appeal, my dear brothers and sisters. Watch out for people who cause divisions and upset people\u2019s faith by teaching things contrary to what you have been taught. Stay away from them. Such people are not serving Christ our Lord; they are serving their own personal interests. By smooth talk and glowing words they deceive innocent people. Deuteronomy 25:2 If the person in the wrong is sentenced to be flogged, the judge must command him to lie down and be beaten in his presence with the number of lashes appropriate to the crime. God's discipline is a blessing that He brings to preserve us and prevent us from being destroyed by sin. Revelation 3:19 I correct and discipline everyone I love. So be diligent and turn from your indifference. Atheist Atheist refuses to believe in God and rejects the truth of the Bible. He is walking in the opposite direction, away from Zion and the Celestial City and toward Vanity and Destruction. He no longer seeks eternal life. He no longer fears eternal judgment. In fact, he no longer believes in the reality of heaven and hell. Ecclesiastes 10:15 Fools are so exhausted by a little work that they can\u2019t even find their way home. 2 Corinthians 5:7 For we live by believing and not by seeing. Proverbs 19:27 If you stop listening to instruction, my child, you will turn your back on knowledge. 1 John 2:21 So I am writing to you not because you don\u2019t know the truth but because you know the difference between truth and lies. Enchanted Ground The Enchanted Ground represents dullness brought about by spiritual complacency and fatigue. We can settle in and grow too comfortable in our faith. Our worship loses its wonder and becomes too routine. Also, living as a Christian in a world filled with sin is hard. Rising day after day, fighting the same old battles against sin, can be wearisome. 1 Thessalonians 5:6 So be on your guard, not asleep like the others. Stay alert and be clearheaded. Ecclesiastes 4:9 Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed. Romans 6:21-23 And what was the result? You are now ashamed of the things you used to do, things that end in eternal doom. But now you are free from the power of sin and have become slaves of God. Now you do those things that lead to holiness and result in eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord. Ephesians 5:6 Don\u2019t be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins, for the anger of God will fall on all who disobey him. Isaiah 64:6 We are all infected and impure with sin. When we display our righteous deeds, they are nothing but filthy rags. Like autumn leaves, we wither and fall, and our sins sweep us away like the wind. Galatians 2:16 Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law.\u201d Luke 17:10 In the same way, when you obey me you should say, \u2018We are unworthy servants who have simply done our duty.\u2019\u201d Hopeful's account of his conversion with Faithful Each Christian has their own spiritual journey - although there may be some common aspects. Hebrews 10:12-21 But our High Priest offered himself to God as a single sacrifice for sins, good for all time. Then he sat down in the place of honor at God\u2019s right hand. There he waits until his enemies are humbled and made a footstool under his feet. For by that one offering he forever made perfect those who are being made holy. And the Holy Spirit also testifies that this is so. For he says, \u201cThis is the new covenant I will make with my people on that day, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.\u201d Then he says, \u201cI will never again remember their sins and lawless deeds.\u201d And when sins have been forgiven, there is no need to offer any more sacrifices. And so, dear brothers and sisters, we can boldly enter heaven\u2019s Most Holy Place because of the blood of Jesus. By his death, Jesus opened a new and life-giving way through the curtain into the Most Holy Place. And since we have a great High Priest who rules over God\u2019s house, Romans 4:5 But people are counted as righteous, not because of their work, but because of their faith in God who forgives sinners. Matthew 11:28 Then Jesus said, \u201cCome to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Matthew 24:35 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. Psalms 95:6 Come, let us worship and bow down. Let us kneel before the Lord our maker, Jeremiah 29:12-13 In those days when you pray, I will listen. If you look for me wholeheartedly, you will find me. Exodus 25:22 I will meet with you there and talk to you from above the atonement cover between the gold cherubim that hover over the Ark of the Covenant. From there I will give you my commands for the people of Israel. Habakkuk 2:3 This vision is for a future time. It describes the end, and it will be fulfilled. If it seems slow in coming, wait patiently, for it will surely take place. It will not be delayed. Ephesians 1:18-19 I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can understand the confident hope he has given to those he called\u2014his holy people who are his rich and glorious inheritance. I also pray that you will understand the incredible greatness of God\u2019s power for us who believe him. This is the same mighty power Acts 16:31 They replied, \u201cBelieve in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, along with everyone in your household.\u201d * 2 Corinthians 12:9 Each time he said, \u201cMy grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.\u201d So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me. * John 6:35 Jesus replied, \u201cI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry again. Whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. John 6:37 However, those the Father has given me will come to me, and I will never reject them. Romans 10:4 For Christ has already accomplished the purpose for which the law was given. As a result, all who believe in him are made right with God. Romans 4:25 He was handed over to die because of our sins, and he was raised to life to make us right with God. Revelation 1:5 and from Jesus Christ. He is the faithful witness to these things, the first to rise from the dead, and the ruler of all the kings of the world. All glory to him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by shedding his blood for us. 1 Timothy 2:5 For, There is one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity\u2014the man Christ Jesus. Hebrews 7:25 Therefore he is able, once and forever, to save those who come to God through him. He lives forever to intercede with God on their behalf. Christian and Ignorance Ignorance thinks about God and heaven, but even the demons believe Ignorance has wrongly judged his heart to be good. He is not convinced of the depth of his sin or his need of a Savior. He finds comfort in himself\u2014his good works, his positive outlook, his self-determination. Proverbs 13:4 Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper. Proverbs 28:26 Those who trust their own insight are foolish, but anyone who walks in wisdom is safe. Genesis 6:5 The Lord observed the extent of human wickedness on the earth, and he saw that everything they thought or imagined was consistently and totally evil. Genesis 8:21 And the Lord was pleased with the aroma of the sacrifice and said to himself, \u201cI will never again curse the ground because of the human race, even though everything they think or imagine is bent toward evil from childhood. I will never again destroy all living things. Romans 3:12 All have turned away; all have become useless. No one does good, not a single one.\u201d Romans 4:5 But people are counted as righteous, not because of their work, but because of their faith in God who forgives sinners. Ephesians 1:17-19 asking God, the glorious Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to give you spiritual wisdom and insight so that you might grow in your knowledge of God. I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can understand the confident hope he has given to those he called\u2014his holy people who are his rich and glorious inheritance. I also pray that you will understand the incredible greatness of God\u2019s power for us who believe him.

Galatians 2:16 Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law.\u201d Luke 17:10 In the same way, when you obey me you should say, \u2018We are unworthy servants who have simply done our duty.\u2019\u201d","title":"Enchanted Ground"},{"location":"pilgrims-progress/stage9/#hopefuls-account-of-his-conversion-with-faithful","text":"Each Christian has their own spiritual journey - although there may be some common aspects. Hebrews 10:12-21 But our High Priest offered himself to God as a single sacrifice for sins, good for all time. Then he sat down in the place of honor at God\u2019s right hand. There he waits until his enemies are humbled and made a footstool under his feet. For by that one offering he forever made perfect those who are being made holy. And the Holy Spirit also testifies that this is so. For he says, \u201cThis is the new covenant I will make with my people on that day, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.\u201d Then he says, \u201cI will never again remember their sins and lawless deeds.\u201d And when sins have been forgiven, there is no need to offer any more sacrifices. And so, dear brothers and sisters, we can boldly enter heaven\u2019s Most Holy Place because of the blood of Jesus. By his death, Jesus opened a new and life-giving way through the curtain into the Most Holy Place. And since we have a great High Priest who rules over God\u2019s house, Romans 4:5 But people are counted as righteous, not because of their work, but because of their faith in God who forgives sinners. Matthew 11:28 Then Jesus said, \u201cCome to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.

Exodus 25:22 I will meet with you there and talk to you from above the atonement cover between the gold cherubim that hover over the Ark of the Covenant. From there I will give you my commands for the people of Israel. Habakkuk 2:3 This vision is for a future time. It describes the end, and it will be fulfilled. If it seems slow in coming, wait patiently, for it will surely take place. It will not be delayed. Ephesians 1:18-19 I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can understand the confident hope he has given to those he called\u2014his holy people who are his rich and glorious inheritance. I also pray that you will understand the incredible greatness of God\u2019s power for us who believe him. This is the same mighty power Acts 16:31 They replied, \u201cBelieve in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, along with everyone in your household.\u201d * 2 Corinthians 12:9 Each time he said, \u201cMy grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.\u201d So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me. * John 6:35 Jesus replied, \u201cI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry again. Whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. John 6:37 However, those the Father has given me will come to me, and I will never reject them. Romans 10:4 For Christ has already accomplished the purpose for which the law was given. As a result, all who believe in him are made right with God. Romans 4:25 He was handed over to die because of our sins, and he was raised to life to make us right with God. Revelation 1:5 and from Jesus Christ. He is the faithful witness to these things, the first to rise from the dead, and the ruler of all the kings of the world. All glory to him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by shedding his blood for us. 1 Timothy 2:5 For, There is one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity\u2014the man Christ Jesus.

A quick summary is that we talked about how God wants us to pray (we've heard that before) but that He also needs our prayers. We talked about how our physical actions can affect people's lives (we can drive drunk, or choose to help someone in danger), so why wouldn't our prayers affect people as well? We imagined a reservoir of power that God set aside, and how it is like a trust fund, where we both have to release it together. It is a big change in thinking to imagine God needing anything - which we were able to discuss a lot last night. I took some time during breakfast today to look up some verses that seem to show how prayer impacted God's decision. In trying to keep this note shorter, I am trimming out some parts of the passages, so it might be good to look them up and read them in their full context. (The translation I am using is NASB) Exodus 32:11-14 Then Moses entreated the Lord his God, and said, \u201cO Lord, why does Your anger burn against Your people whom You have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, \u2018With evil intent He brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth\u2019? Turn from Your burning anger and change Your mind about doing harm to Your people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants to whom You swore by Yourself, and said to them, \u2018I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.\u2019\u201d So the Lord changed His mind about the harm which He said He would do to His people. This was after Moses met with God and then came down to find the Israelites worshiping the golden calf. God said He would destroy them, but in the passage above you can see Moses interceding on their behalf. The last verse shows God changing his mind (in other translations it says that God relented). 2 Kings 20:1-6 In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, \u201cThus says the Lord, \u2018Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.\u2019\u201d Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, saying, \u201cRemember now, O Lord, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart and have done what is good in Your sight.\u201d And Hezekiah wept bitterly. Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, \u201cReturn and say to Hezekiah the leader of My people, \u2018Thus says the Lord, the God of your father David, \u201cI have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord. I will add fifteen years to your life, and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for My own sake and for My servant David\u2019s sake.\u201d\u2019\u201d Here God told Hezekiah that he would be dead soon. Hezekiah wept, prayed, and beseeched the Lord. God then told Hezekiah that he heard his prayers and would add 15 years onto his life. Exodus 17:11 (This one is from a story that has always fascinated me) So it came about when Moses held his hand up, that Israel prevailed, and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed. The Israelites were in a battle with the Amalekites. When Moses kept his staff lifted up, the Israelites were winning, but when he let his hands come down, they would start to lose. His arms got tired, and his brother and friend had to help him keep his hands up so that they would win the battle. I certainly don't believe Moses was a magician or that his staff had some supernatural powers. I believe that God helped the Israelites win as long as Moses kept his staff raised high. This passage doesn't mention anything about prayer, but it does show how Moses directly influenced the supernatural. I think it is a good way to envision our prayers as well. Imagine if we could see the results of our prayers like that! Numbers 14:12-20 The Lord said to Moses, \u201cHow long will this people spurn Me? And how long will they not believe in Me, despite all the signs which I have performed in their midst? I will smite them with pestilence and dispossess them\"... But Moses said to the Lord ... Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness, just as You also have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.\u201d So the Lord said, \u201cI have pardoned them according to your word.\" I cut a lot out of this one because it was a big passage. Basically, the Israelites rebelled against God and said they would rather go back to Egypt. God says he was going to smite them, but Moses interceded on their behalf. God said that he would pardon them as Moses requested. Jeremiah 18:11 (This type of verse is familiar in the old testament) Thus says the Lord, \u201cBehold, I am fashioning calamity against you and devising a plan against you. Oh turn back, each of you from his evil way, and reform your ways and your deeds.\u201d This makes you wonder - is it an idle threat, or would God really destroy them if they don't reform their ways? We see multiple times that when Israel didn't repent, their nation was smashed and they were killed and taken as slaves - so I do not take it as an idle threat. We also see times when Israel did repent, and they lived prosperous lives (until the next time they neglected God). Ezekiel 22:30 I searched for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before Me for the land, so that I would not destroy it; but I found no one. That one is amazing: God is looking for someone to \"stand in the gap\" for the land!

Psalm 139:21-23 Do I not hate those who hate You, O Lord? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You? I hate them with the utmost hatred; They have become my enemies. Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try me and know my anxious thoughts; Psalm 58:8,10 Let them be as a snail which melts away as it goes along, Like the miscarriages of a woman which never see the sun.

Psalm 137:8-9 O daughter of Babylon, you devastated one, How blessed will be the one who repays you With the recompense with which you have repaid us. How blessed will be the one who seizes and dashes your little ones Against the rock. Here are the verses of Job talking to God: Job 9:22-24 \u201cIt is all one; therefore I say, \u2018He destroys the guiltless and the wicked.\u2019 \u201cIf the scourge kills suddenly, He mocks the despair of the innocent. \u201cThe earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not He, then who is it? Job 16:9 His anger has torn me and hunted me down, He has gnashed at me with His teeth; My adversary glares at me. Job 21:15 \u2018Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, And what would we gain if we entreat Him?\u2019 Job 24:12 From the city men groan, And the souls of the wounded cry out; Yet God does not pay attention to folly. Job 30:21-22 You have become cruel to me; With the might of Your hand You persecute me. You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride; And You dissolve me in a storm.

Recap from last night It is easy to fall into building rules and rituals around your prayer life, but what God really wants from us is honest communication built on a relationship with Him. The \"assignment\" we talked about was trying to carve out some regular time to meet with God, where you just tell Him how you are feeling - be honest with Him. Don't worry about prayer requests, praying in a certain order, or anything like that - just \"hang out\" with God, like we would with any other friend. I think that once we build an honest relationship with God, the praise, confession, prayer requests, etc. will all just come naturally. Let's also try to encourage each other in this as well. Maybe we can share what we are experiencing when we meet with God, share what time of the day or what place seems to work the best, or maybe just remind each other to keep meeting with God.

We started out by reading Mark 11:24 : Therefore I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted you. I mentioned that the topic would be about our faith. Strength-Tester Faith The first couple of segments we listened to dealt with \"Strength Testers Faith\" - where you feel you have to believe super hard, and try not to doubt in order to have faith. You almost have to mentally trick yourself into believing something, because you are worried that if you have doubt, that would mean you have a lack of faith, and according to Mark 11:24 , not believing means you are reducing your chance of receiving. I don't think I always approach prayer this way, but I certainly have been there (which is kind of funny, because God knows our heart - He would know deep down if we doubt that something will come to pass even though we pray for it). Contradictions We heard some examples of why this verse seems to contradict other verses in the Bible, like the verse where Jesus healed the blind man. He spit in his eyes, prayed, and asked the man if he could see. If he took his own words from Mark 11:24 literally, then why would he ask the blind man if he could see? Shouldn't the man just believe that he could see and then he would be able to. (A bonus to this story was that the man couldn't see all the way, and Jesus had to pray again - that is profound!) Variables We then heard a TON of different variables that may affect the outcome of prayer - I will try to list some that I remember: Having 2 or more people praying The faith of the person praying The faith of the person being prayed for The spiritual forces working against your prayer The spiritual forces working for your prayer The list was a lot bigger than that, but the point is, there are so many factors that can affect the outcome of prayer, that we can never be certain of the outcome. If you take Mark 11:24 literally, it is telling you to be certain of the outcome in order for it to happen. Since we can't be certain, then what does the verse mean? Hyperbole We then learned that it was very common in the time of the early church to use hyperbole to get a point across. The example was \"Johnny, I've told you a million times to stop that!\" Obviously you haven't been keeping count, or come close to 1 million times - that is a hyperbole to get your point across. We learned about some other verses that are hyperboles as well: \"If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out\" doesn't really mean that we should pluck our eyes out - it drives home the point that we need to deal with temptation and what we allow ourselves to see. What's the point? So if Mark 11:24 is an exaggeration to prove a point, what point is it trying to prove? The opinion given Sunday was that Mark 11:24 is showing us that envisioning the results of our prayers aligns us with God's heart, and our prayers will start to align with God's will. (I'm still having trouble getting this out on paper - we really worked through a lot on Sunday, and I feel it was really clear... I'm just praying that what I am writing will make sense!) The point of the verse wasn't that if you can imagine or believe it coming true, it will come true - it was that getting your attitude and your heart set on the results of your prayer will begin to align you with God's heart. An example Maybe an example will help: When I was growing up, we cleaned the house every Monday. If I thought about it with a negative attitude througout the weekend (dreaded it, complained about having to clean) - when Monday came around, I would get into little fights with my mom while we were cleaning, and my cleaning efforts were prettly lousy - I didn't do a good job. However, if I thought about having a clean house, and the fun I could have after the house was clean all weekend long, when Monday came, I worked together with my family and did a great job cleaning (and we probably finished a lot faster too!) In a way, because I \"believed I would receive\" (my heart was in the right place), \"it was granted to me\" (the cleaning job went great!) By aligning my attitude with my mom's heart to have a clean house, we ended up with a nice clean house, and a happy family. Anyways - it's not about a mental trick to try to get our prayers answered - it's about stepping out in faith and trusting God to do his work. Another example One example we heard of this type of prayer was the pastor was praying for a friend with insomnia. As he prayed for this person, he pictured them sound asleep, smiling, on a nice soft bed. Again - this is not new-agey, or magical. It just gives us the right attitude as we pray. It will probably make the prayer more real to us, and make us more passionate while we pray. Aligning with God We talked about how it could even happen where we may be praying in one direction, but as we are envisioning what we are praying for, it aligns us with God's heart, and the spirit may prompt us to pray in another direction, aligning us further with God's heart. As I have been trying to pray this way, I do find there is a new passion to my prayer. It helps it feel more real to envision the person I am praying for, and to feel more passionate about praying for them. Closing At the end of our discussion, there were some questions and answers about praying with faith. Since this post super long, I will put the questions/answers in a different post, hopefully this weekend. God bless you all - thanks for going on this \"journey\" with me to learn how to strengthen our prayer lives!","title":"Prayer 3"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer3/#prayer-3","text":"10/25/2013 I've been working through what we discussed on Sunday night enough to try to write it out. We started out by reading Mark 11:24 : Therefore I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted you. I mentioned that the topic would be about our faith.","title":"Prayer #3"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer3/#strength-tester-faith","text":"The first couple of segments we listened to dealt with \"Strength Testers Faith\" - where you feel you have to believe super hard, and try not to doubt in order to have faith. You almost have to mentally trick yourself into believing something, because you are worried that if you have doubt, that would mean you have a lack of faith, and according to Mark 11:24 , not believing means you are reducing your chance of receiving. I don't think I always approach prayer this way, but I certainly have been there (which is kind of funny, because God knows our heart - He would know deep down if we doubt that something will come to pass even though we pray for it).","title":"Strength-Tester Faith"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer3/#contradictions","text":"We heard some examples of why this verse seems to contradict other verses in the Bible, like the verse where Jesus healed the blind man. He spit in his eyes, prayed, and asked the man if he could see. If he took his own words from Mark 11:24 literally, then why would he ask the blind man if he could see? Shouldn't the man just believe that he could see and then he would be able to. (A bonus to this story was that the man couldn't see all the way, and Jesus had to pray again - that is profound!)","title":"Contradictions"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer3/#variables","text":"We then heard a TON of different variables that may affect the outcome of prayer - I will try to list some that I remember: Having 2 or more people praying The faith of the person praying The faith of the person being prayed for The spiritual forces working against your prayer The spiritual forces working for your prayer The list was a lot bigger than that, but the point is, there are so many factors that can affect the outcome of prayer, that we can never be certain of the outcome. If you take Mark 11:24 literally, it is telling you to be certain of the outcome in order for it to happen. Since we can't be certain, then what does the verse mean?","title":"Variables"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer3/#hyperbole","text":"We then learned that it was very common in the time of the early church to use hyperbole to get a point across. The example was \"Johnny, I've told you a million times to stop that!\" Obviously you haven't been keeping count, or come close to 1 million times - that is a hyperbole to get your point across. We learned about some other verses that are hyperboles as well: \"If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out\" doesn't really mean that we should pluck our eyes out - it drives home the point that we need to deal with temptation and what we allow ourselves to see.","title":"Hyperbole"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer3/#whats-the-point","text":"So if Mark 11:24 is an exaggeration to prove a point, what point is it trying to prove? The opinion given Sunday was that Mark 11:24 is showing us that envisioning the results of our prayers aligns us with God's heart, and our prayers will start to align with God's will. (I'm still having trouble getting this out on paper - we really worked through a lot on Sunday, and I feel it was really clear... I'm just praying that what I am writing will make sense!) The point of the verse wasn't that if you can imagine or believe it coming true, it will come true - it was that getting your attitude and your heart set on the results of your prayer will begin to align you with God's heart.","title":"What's the point?"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer3/#an-example","text":"Maybe an example will help: When I was growing up, we cleaned the house every Monday.

However, if I thought about having a clean house, and the fun I could have after the house was clean all weekend long, when Monday came, I worked together with my family and did a great job cleaning (and we probably finished a lot faster too!) In a way, because I \"believed I would receive\" (my heart was in the right place), \"it was granted to me\" (the cleaning job went great!)

Question #1 \"If knowing God is so important, why doesn't God make it easier to know the truth?\" Some of the fogginess between us and God is a result of us living in a fallen world. God doesn't will the \"fog\" to be there, but he can use it: he wants us to seek him ( Matthew 7:7 ). He wants a bride who pursues him and will work on the relationship. Those who have a heart for God will pursue and ask questions. There have been times in the Bible where God cuts through the fog to make himself obvious. We can say \"If only I had God speak to me through a burning bush, then I would believe\" - but most of the time in the Bible when these things happened, there was an initial awe of God, but in time, that would fade away. When God is obvious and shows up to His people directly, it does not always have the impact you think it would. Question #2 How can I increase my faith if I don't have an active imagination You do have an imagination, you probably just aren't visual. Think about something good that is going to happen in the near future (Job promotion, going out on a date, seeing a loved one, etc). If you feel any excitement when thinking about this event, you are imagining it. Have you ever been excited about anything in the future? If you have, it is because you were imagining what it was going to be like. Maybe you aren't visual and can't \"see\" it; instead you imagine the sounds or the feeling of it - this is still your imagination. You couldn't remember anything, or anticipate anything if you didn't have an imagination. When praying, enter into that imagination, and magnify it - try to think about it with all 5 senses. This creates a response in us as though it was real. It is a neurological fact that the way we think and imagine is by our brain re-activating neurons in our brain that are roughly the same as when we experience it in reality. We remember and anticipate things by replicating the reality of it in our minds. Praying in faith is anticipating what we are praying for by thinking about it as though it is real. As we discussed on Sunday, this makes us more passionate about what we are praying about and begins to align us with God's heart. Question #3 How do we deal with disappointments when our prayers aren't answered? This may be the case of the \"strength tester\" model of faith where you believe if you don't receive what you prayed for, you must not have had enough faith or prayed hard enough. Instead, start out by admitting that you don't know whether the prayer will be answered the way you want it, but knowing that your prayer will have kingdom impact. There are so many variables that affect the outcome of prayers. Being aware of that can help you not feel so disappointed if a prayer is not \"answered\". Your prayer is a success because you are obeying God by stepping out in faith, even though you don't know what the outcome will be. Define success by obeying God by exercising the kind of faith He wants us to have. Question #4 Why don't we see more healings happen? (My note: The pastor states that this answer is all his opinion. He has no idea why we don't see more miracles, but here is a way he explains it, using an analogy) There is nothing in the New Testament that indicates that miracles were supposed to stop, but by the second century, miracles started to happen less. In the 4th century, the church started to believe that miracles were only for the early church. Looking through history, you can see that miracles come in pockets, or outbreaks. Revivals happen sporadically through history, often accompanied by miracles. This probably isn't because we lack faith during the \"down times\". There are many other variables that are influencing what is going on. We are in a world that is spiritually oppressed, kind of like the earth is \"oppressed\" by clouds that block the sunlight. God's power is like the sun, and once in a while (for reasons we can't understand), the clouds break a little bit and the power of God falls on earth, like the sun breaking through the clouds. This can bring an outbreak of miracles and a revival, but eventually the clouds close up again. The \"clouds\" are not equal all over the earth - they seem to be thinner in some 3rd world countries where miracles tend to happen more often. Maybe they have more faith, or maybe there are just so many other things in those areas that we will never understand which affect the spiritual realm in their area of the earth. The bottom line : We don't know why miracles don't happen very often, but it shouldn't affect how we live. Continue to be obedient to God by praying in faith, and trust that God is in control. If you are praying for someone to be healed, exercise your faith by seeing their healing as vividly as you can and press forward in your prayers for their healing. But don't blame yourself if that person is not healed - there are so many other variables we cannot know.","title":"Prayer 3 Q&A"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer3qa/#prayer-3-qa","text":"10/25/2013 I was finally able to transcribe the questions and answers that we didn't get to listen to on Sunday.","title":"Prayer #3 - Q&amp;A"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer3qa/#question-1","text":"","title":"Question #1"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer3qa/#if-knowing-god-is-so-important-why-doesnt-god-make-it-easier-to-know-the-truth","text":"Some of the fogginess between us and God is a result of us living in a fallen world.

Seeing We learned that the Hebrew word for dream and vision are the same word - it basically describes a kind of \"seeing\" that takes place in our mind. We talked about 2 Corinthians 3:14-18 where Paul describes this type of seeing, and uses the analogy of our mind being like a mirror in which we can \"see\" God. \"Seeing\" God this way eventually transforms us: When we imagine God's love for us, it makes us more loving; when we imagine God's joy over us, it makes us more joyful. Reality We also learned that satan doesn't want us to use our imagination this way - a good example is how today people mostly associate your imagination with fantasy - creating images in your mind that are not real to escape reality. We talked about how imagination can actually bring you closer to reality: Describing a loved one, a room in your house, etc. You could recite facts about these things, but a better way to describe them accurately is to picture them in your mind (using your imagination), and the more vividly you can imagine them, the reality of them becomes that much more clear. Aligning with God We also talked for a while on how using your imagination during prayer can align you with God's will. The example was if you had a conflict in your family - a classic way to pray about this would be to pray for the family member, that God would \"change their heart\", or \"help them come around\". But, if you use your imagination while praying for the family member, you see them as an actual person in your mind, and maybe you end up praying that you would learn how to love them more, or that God would simply bless them. Maybe God's way for them to \"change their heart\" was to let them see how much you love them. This is obviously just an example of what could happen, but it illustrates how praying with your imagination can open you up more to allow the Holy Spirit to change your perspective, thus aligning you more with God's will. When we pray without our imagination, we tend to just say words, and these words usually end up being what we want God to do. When we pray with our imagination, we allow ourselves to get a better picture of what God wants to do - it somehow opens us up more to the Holy Spirit's promptings. Examples We also heard some good examples of how to use your imagination in prayer. One neat example was when praying for someone, imagine a huge spot-light beam of light falling down on that person as you pray for them - the spot-light represents the power of your prayer through God falling upon them. This is actually helping you visualize the reality of your prayer (not that our prayer is like a spot-light on them, but your prayer is making a kingdom impact). Seeing it concretely in your mind will give you the passion and energy to pursue it, and helps us push harder with God to help bring about his will in Heaven here on earth. Listening to God We also wrapped up with how using your imagination in prayer makes you more receptive to God communicating back with us. So many Christians only talk to God, but never listen for Him. A main reason is because it is hard to hear Him - but when using our imagination we can \"hear\" his prompting even more. A concern in this is that we worry that our imagination is just telling ourselves what we want to hear and not actually God - if you hear a word from God, and you can back it up in scripture, trust that it is God talking to you. We also thought that this part of listening to God with our imagination would take time and practice, but as we deepen our communication with God, it will be more clear what is God and what is our mind. Challenge I was pretty excited after our discussion on Sunday. I would challenge you guys to try to cut out a few minutes of your (busy!) days to practice this. We talked about how even praying for something simple like having a good day tomorrow becomes a totally different prayer when using your imagination. Instead of saying the words \"Please help me to have a good day tomorrow\", praying for that in your imagination leads you to pray for people you will come into contact with, and to pray a lot more specifically for your day in general. Stay Focused! Your prayers may wander a bit, but that could just be the Holy Spirit directing your prayers! I think the reason I struggle with a meaningful prayer time is because just saying words is dry and (to be honest) boring. At first, I wanted to be doing something else rather then setting aside a few minutes to talk with God, but what I have found is that by using my imagination while praying I am way more passionate about it - but also, my prayer time lasts a lot longer than I thought it would, and I can't wait to pray again the next time. Next Week The plan for next Sunday is to cover 1 Thess. 5:17 - Pray without ceasing! In the next week or so, try to think about these questions: What draws your attention away from being present with Jesus in every moment of your life? Who in your life or what ways can you remind yourself to be present with Jesus throughout your day?","title":"Prayer 4"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer4/#prayer-4","text":"11/7/2013","title":"Prayer #4"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer4/#quick-summary","text":"Using your imagination while praying can make your prayer time more passionate and align you with God's heart because it gives you a picture in your mind of the reality of what you are praying for.","title":"Quick summary:"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer4/#seeing","text":"We learned that the Hebrew word for dream and vision are the same word - it basically describes a kind of \"seeing\" that takes place in our mind.

God's Presence We talked about God's omnipresence being categorized 2 different ways: God's sustaining presence, and God's Holy presence. When sin entered the world, a division took place here on earth because His Holy presence was blocked out by sin (this was described as secular versus sacred). God is omnipresent in the way that He sustains everything in existence. His Holy presence, however, exists more in certain areas than others. In the Old Testament, His Holy presence was usually centered around the tabernacle or the temple. In the New Testament, His Holy presence is present when people allow it in their lives. When we ask God to be the Lord of our life, our \"address\" changes, and we are placed in the center of His Holy presence. In addition, Christ also enters us when we are saved. This means that the moment we asked Jesus into our hearts, there is no longer a distinction between secular and sacred: Any/every place we go is a sacred place, because we are in the middle of His Holy presence. We don't need to go to church to go to a sacred place, we don't need to go to a special place to pray, we don't even need to set aside specific times to pray, because we are always in the presence of God. Specific Prayer Times A side note on setting aside specific times to pray: We discussed how it is still important to set aside regular times to meet with God in prayer, but that is not the only time you can pray. We compared it to a marriage relationship: It is important for a couple to set aside regular times to spend quality time with each other, but the relationship is not confined to those special times. We can communicate and build the relationship anytime we are around our spouse. It's the same with God, only we are always in His presence! A commitment We also heard how when we committed our life to Jesus, it was not just about the pledge we made. It is not a matter of pledging to live your life for God and then forgetting about it for the rest of your life. Your life is actually a series of moments strung together. A commitment to live for God is not a one-time deal - it is a continual surrendering of your life, every moment of every day. Functional Atheists We heard the comparison of most christian lives to \"functional atheists\" - which is uncomfortable to hear. What this means is that while we do have some \"sacred\" times in our lives (when we go to church, pray to God, give thanks for a meal), the majority of our \"normal\" lives are spent without giving God a second thought - much like an atheist would spend their lives. Instead of living like a functional atheist, we are called to abide (remain, stay) in Him, and you will bear fruit. Abiding with His spirit produces the fruit of the spirit! We try to produce our own fruit when we are not abiding in Him. Pray Continually All of these thoughts got pulled together and connected for us with the 2-word verse of 1 Thessalonians 5:16 - Pray continually. This sounds pretty impossible, especially in the middle of our busy lives with young children, careers, etc. How can we pray non-stop? This goes back to John 15:4 where we are called to abide in Him. It doesn't necessarily mean talking to God non-stop - It is a mindset and an awareness that we are always in His Holy presence. Conversations We heard the example of how we have conversations with ourselves in our head when we think. This sounds crazy, but if you look at how you process your thoughts, you are having mini conversations with yourself. To abide in God's presence is to include Him on those conversations in your head. An added benefit of including God in your ongoing thoughts is that you are making yourself more receptive to hear what God has to say to you. Three Tips This all still feels daunting and very difficult, so we talked about 3 tips that can help: Imagine God as your invisible friend who is always right next to you. (Remember a couple of weeks ago when we talked about imagination, and how imagination is not just used to imagine made up things, but can also be used to bring reality closer? This is the same thing, because, as this sermon talked about, we are always in the presence of God. To imagine that He is sitting next to you is just picturing reality!) Experiment with making your thoughts a 3-way conversations. Include God in every thought process. Start out with something easy or mindless, like when you are going for a jog. Make a conscious effort to include God in your thoughts, and see how long you can keep it up. As you practice this more and more, it will become second nature and you will be abiding in His presence. Setup reminders and accountability. How quickly after we left on Sunday did we go on our way and forget we were in the middle of God's Holy presence? By giving yourself reminders, and inviting other people to remind you, you can be more aware of God's presence. Checkpoint So - how have you been doing on keeping your thoughts in His presence? I'll be honest - it is hard. I've been driving to-and-from work without the radio this week to be more conscious of His presence (I'm not saying that I'll never listen to the radio again - it just seemed like a good place to start. Eventually, when I am dwelling in His presence more often than not, we can have conversations about what we hear on the radio!) It seems to be getting easier, but I am so conditioned to being in my own thoughts... Work together Like we also mentioned on Sunday, feel free to share tips on what helps you focus on His presence throughout the day. The term \"functional atheist\" is definitely uncomfortable for me to be compared to, but probably because I know it is somewhat accurate. By working together as a group to challenge each other, we can help each other move from being less of a functional atheist, and more of a child of God who abides in Him. One more thing I just wanted to add that while sin is an obstacle to God's presence, and the fact that most of our normal lives are spent not even thinking about God - those don't cancel out what God did on the cross for us. But by not abiding in His presence, you are missing out on hearing His direction and producing His fruit of the spirit. I just didn't want it to come across like you aren't saved if you aren't abiding in His presence :) Abiding in His presence is what the human heart is hungry for, so let's let God fulfill that hunger!","title":"Prayer 5 - Living in Communication"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer5/#prayer-5","text":"11/20/2013 Here is the recap from the sermon and our discussion on Sunday:","title":"Prayer #5"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer5/#verses","text":"We started out reading a few verses ( Psalm 27:4 , 1 Corinthians 6:19 , 1 Corinthians 3:16 , John 15:4 ) that had the theme of God's presence being with us and in us, and followed it up with 1 Thessalonians 5:16 (Pray continually).","title":"Verses"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer5/#gods-presence","text":"We talked about God's omnipresence being categorized 2 different ways: God's sustaining presence, and God's Holy presence. When sin entered the world, a division took place here on earth because His Holy presence was blocked out by sin (this was described as secular versus sacred). God is omnipresent in the way that He sustains everything in existence. His Holy presence, however, exists more in certain areas than others. In the Old Testament, His Holy presence was usually centered around the tabernacle or the temple. In the New Testament, His Holy presence is present when people allow it in their lives. When we ask God to be the Lord of our life, our \"address\" changes, and we are placed in the center of His Holy presence. In addition, Christ also enters us when we are saved. This means that the moment we asked Jesus into our hearts, there is no longer a distinction between secular and sacred: Any/every place we go is a sacred place, because we are in the middle of His Holy presence. We don't need to go to church to go to a sacred place, we don't need to go to a special place to pray, we don't even need to set aside specific times to pray, because we are always in the presence of God.","title":"God's Presence"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer5/#specific-prayer-times","text":"A side note on setting aside specific times to pray: We discussed how it is still important to set aside regular times to meet with God in prayer, but that is not the only time you can pray. We compared it to a marriage relationship: It is important for a couple to set aside regular times to spend quality time with each other, but the relationship is not confined to those special times. We can communicate and build the relationship anytime we are around our spouse. It's the same with God, only we are always in His presence!","title":"Specific Prayer Times"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer5/#a-commitment","text":"We also heard how when we committed our life to Jesus, it was not just about the pledge we made. It is not a matter of pledging to live your life for God and then forgetting about it for the rest of your life. Your life is actually a series of moments strung together. A commitment to live for God is not a one-time deal - it is a continual surrendering of your life, every moment of every day.","title":"A commitment"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer5/#functional-atheists","text":"We heard the comparison of most christian lives to \"functional atheists\" - which is uncomfortable to hear. What this means is that while we do have some \"sacred\" times in our lives (when we go to church, pray to God, give thanks for a meal), the majority of our \"normal\" lives are spent without giving God a second thought - much like an atheist would spend their lives. Instead of living like a functional atheist, we are called to abide (remain, stay) in Him, and you will bear fruit. Abiding with His spirit produces the fruit of the spirit! We try to produce our own fruit when we are not abiding in Him.","title":"Functional Atheists"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer5/#pray-continually","text":"All of these thoughts got pulled together and connected for us with the 2-word verse of 1 Thessalonians 5:16 - Pray continually.

We started out by reading some verses in Psalms that talk about how we worship God (lifting our hands, shouting to Him, playing instruments, etc.) Then we heard a way to think of worship as \"shipping worth\" to God - the actions and thoughts during our worship should be focused on ascribing worth to Him. The worship time at church on Sundays is more than just a prelude to the sermon. Just like we talked about with prayer last time - prayer isn't just a once-in-a-while thing... it is a mindset that we should always be in, to pray continuously. The same goes for worship: It is not just a once-a-week thing - we are to worship God through our thoughts and our actions every moment of every day. This does not mean we should be walking around mumbling praises to Him - anything that brings glory to God is a form of worship. When we choose not to gossip, we are worshiping God. When we help someone in need, we are worshiping God. Like we talked about last time about the secular versus the sacred... When we are living in the sacred, we are worshiping God. So when we show up for a time of worship on Sunday, we are just transitioning from one form of worship to another form of worship (expressing it through music). Body and Heart Then we talked about how the body and our heart are connected... the abundance of joy in our heart will (if we don't stop it) be expressed in our body. What we do with our body, affects our heart, and what goes on in the heart needs to be expressed with our body (through singing, dancing, shouting, clapping, raising hands, etc - all the verses we talked about). Different ways to Worship We talked about the different ways to worship God in music (based on the verses we read at the beginning). We talked about how sometimes dancing for joy and shouting for joy can seem disrespectful in some churches, but in the context of the verses we read, we saw how they bring glory and ascribe worth to God. Of course, you wouldn't want to go to the front of a super conservative church and start dancing, because that would totally be a distraction to everyone there. Also, we talked about how dancing is so \"tainted\" by society, so to bring it into church sounds sacrilegious. We could think of examples, like interpretive dance, where there is no doubt that it is focused on glorifying God. A lot of us noticed the gentleman in the service about a month ago who was dancing during worship - and every single one of us noted how his movements actually brought us further into worship - his dancing was not secular - it was bursting forth out of a love for God. Applause We also noted how when we applaud at the end of a song, it is not to congratulate the musicians - but it is to applaud God who made the musicians and the music. It is a big \"thank you God for being awesome\". Being free to worship Now, talking about expressing our heart with our body sounds pretty scary to some of us who are more quiet and reserved people. We talked about how you don't get bonus \"points\" for dancing rather than singing quietly, and how the people who are clapping aren't necessarily closer to God than the people who are hushed in quiet reverence. We talked about how different cultures tend to be more vocal and animated during worship, where others tend to be more reverent. The point is that you need to be free to worship the way that works for you - worship is all about participation. We ascribe worth to God (ship worth to him - worship) by the intensity of our focus on Him . When our body is expressing what we are singing, we become more passionate and focused on God. An Example To take this a step further - we talked about this example: If you are in a conversation with someone, but you are looking around, noticing everything around you, not really paying attention to them, you are basically letting that person know that they are not that important to you. The same is (even more) true with God. If you are looking around during worship, looking at other people, maybe judging someone because they smell like smoke or aren't singing - you are not focusing on God, and you are basically saying that everything else in the room is more important than Him. I'm not trying to say if you ever get distracted during worship that God isn't important to you - but just remember the example of talking to another person. The more distracted you are, the more you are saying you don't care. Worship becomes worship when we make a decision to block out everything else and to focus everything on the One we are singing to, and what we are singing about. Where's the passion? Okay - all of that was basically an introduction to worship: Having a singular focus (body and heart) on God. Like we have been talking about with prayer - it is very difficult to just sit down and pray some words and feel passionate about it. The same goes for worship - if all we are doing is just singing the words, it will be dry and we are less likely to focus. A way to become more passionate about prayer, and now worship, is to use your imagination. Imagining worship What brings more passion: To sing the words \"The God of angel armies is always by my side. The one who reigns forever - He is a friend of mine\", or to imagine those words are you are singing? For me, to imagine the truth of those words will always bring a passion to my worship rather than just standing there trying to sing the words. Like we talked about with imagination and prayer - it is not trying to make things up - but it brings reality closer. With the lyrics I gave above - imagine God is standing by your side - imagine holding His hand while you sing this song! That's not far fetched or making something up - like we talked about last time, we are always in His presence - so it is not far fetched to imagine Him standing next to us when we sing these words. \"The one who reigns forever, He is a friend of mine\" - He is your friend - imagine Him like you imagine a friend. Another example of a song that makes me imagine in vivid pictures is the hymn \"Holy, Holy, Holy\". Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore thee casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea; cherubim and seraphim falling down before thee which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be. When I am singing this song, it is like I can almost physically see our praises rising up to Him as a sweet perfume. We are the \"saints\" that are adoring Him, and someday we will cast our golden crowns before Him. I try to picture what that will look like - how magnificent it will be. And then to see the heavenly creatures also fall down before Him. To me, that whole scene is exploding with worth, streaming up to God. Like I said, I can almost see it streaming up to Him. That is just my idea and my representation of those words - others may visualize it differently - but either way, I believe it is visualizing truth. And, when I am able to visualize the words of a song like that, those are the closest times I feel to God during worship - the passion and focus is definitely there. Were I just to sing the words, yes, I am still ascribing worth to Him, but I do not think I am as in to it. The next time you are in the worship part of the service, ask the Holy Spirit to help you envision what you are singing about - it can make the worship time so powerful! Worshiping together I mentioned before that the worship part of the service is not the only time of the week that we worship since our actions should bring glory to God throughout the day. However, one awesome part of the worship service at church is that we get to experience that worship with other believers. Also, like I mentioned above, that gentleman who was really into the music helped many people around him focus on God and the worship. The next part we talked about is how our focus (or lack of focus) affects those who are worshiping around us. Not only does our focus on God bring us closer to God, it can help others around us focus more on God. In a sense, we owe it to the people around us to be focused on God during worship. Imagine being in the center of a bunch of people who worship God like that gentleman - after a few songs, I think I would be pretty focused on worship, and probably worshiping with a passion that doesn't happen often. Conversely, if you are in the center of a bunch of people who are only singing (if they are even singing) so they can get through the worship part of the service and get to the sermon. Chances are, those people around you will dampen your worship experience without even knowing it. I'm not saying that you can't have an intimate time with God in the middle of people who aren't focused on God, but I am saying this: Who do you want to be? Do you want to be the person that is so focused on God during worship that without even knowing it, you are causing people to enter into a more passionate time of worship - or - do you want to be the person who doesn't even realize they are causing other people to have a more dry or distracted experience? That's obviously a rhetorical question, but it definitely makes me think twice about going into the worship service... Basically, the worship time is not just for you, but for all of God's people to come together as one body in worship to Him. Diversity The last thing we talked about was the diversity in worship. Obviously people have different likes and dislikes when it comes to music and worship. We are in a society where everyone wants it our way. As a believer, it is a sign of maturity when you can still remain focused on God when a song comes up that you don't know or don't like. If you always had the songs you liked, you wouldn't grow as much. Other people may like the song you don't like, and vice-versa. God's kingdom is for every tribe, every tongue, and every nation. The point is, worship is supposed to be our undivided attention focused on God - it is not about what we can get out of it - it is not for us, but for God. My personal note Also, one personal note I would like to add: The part where we talked about that people worship differently - some quiet and reverent, some raising hands, etc - and how there isn't a right or wrong way. Personally, I tend to use this a bit as an excuse to stay reserved. If my heart is so full of joy that I are feeling led to raise my hands in joy, but I don't because I'm quiet and reserved, I am now believing I am blocking myself from being fully involved in worship. If I am feeling surrendered to God during a song and am feeling to bow or lift up my hands in surrender to Him, but I don't because I'm afraid what people think of me, again - I think I am not letting myself be fully surrendered to God. This is a personal challenge to me, and maybe a challenge to you. Again - you don't need to raise your hands or dance or whatever to get closer to God - but - if you are feeling led to express your worship through your body - I encourage you (and me!) to let go and focus completely on worshiping God - instead of thinking \"I'm more reserved so it's okay if I just stand here\". I don't think I'm saying it clearly - I don't want it to come across wrong... I guess what I'm saying is just go where the Spirit leads - blocking those promptings could be inhibiting your ability to worship fully. Conclusion Now that our series is done, I'm planning on writing a summary of all of the studies - hopefully a short email of just some key points.

I guess what I'm saying is just go where the Spirit leads - blocking those promptings could be inhibiting your ability to worship fully.","title":"My personal note"},{"location":"prayer2013/prayer6/#conclusion","text":"Now that our series is done, I'm planning on writing a summary of all of the studies - hopefully a short email of just some key points.

Some of it has been from sermons I've heard, some from books I've read, and a lot directly from the Bible. In fact, I'm kind of excited for our upcoming study in Colossians, because one of the key passages I wanted to share is from Colossians. Anyways - I really wanted to share what I was learning because it really changed how I look at God's forgiveness and I thought maybe it might be an encouragement to the group. If not, sorry for a long, rambling email =) Or maybe this is common knowledge to everyone except me... Personal background Ever since I was little, I was taught that when we sin, we need to confess our sins to God and ask forgiveness. While I still believe this is true, I think my understanding of why I should do this, is changing. When confessing a sin to God it always felt like I was cowering before the Almighty, begging Him to forgive me. It was the same feeling when I was little: if I did something real bad and I knew I was going to get punished when we got home, I would plead and beg for mom to forgive me so I could hopefully lessen the punishment. At the same time, I was taught that God forgives our sins, and \"once saved, always saved.\" I don't think that I ask God for forgiveness because I'm afraid I'm going to go to hell, but it is a desperate feeling of needing the forgiveness from God after each sin. But like I said, the things I have been learning this summer are really helping transform my thinking about why I ask God for forgiveness, and the true power of His forgiveness. Life-changing verse The verse I read in Colossians really impacted me: Colossians 2:13-14(NIV) \"When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross.\" That first part makes a lot of sense - we were dead in our sins, but God saved us and made us alive with Christ. It was verse 14 that hit me: \"having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness which stood against us and condemned us ; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross\". The verse says that our legal indebtedness condemned us, not God. I have always kind of pictured God as the lightning-bolt-zapping God waiting to punish those who sin against Him, and I had to beg for forgiveness after I sin. But this verse makes it clear (to me, at least) that we were indebted to, and condemned by, the law - but God cancelled that charge and nailed it to the cross! The bad guy here is really the devil - he is the one who demands the payment for our sins. He is the accuser, who accuses us when we sin. Galations 3:13(NIV) says: \"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.\" Romans 8:33(NIV) says: \"Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.\" God doesn't hold our sin over us and demand payment, the accuser (devil) does. God came and he not only paid our debt - he cancelled it. Just like Romans 8:1(NIV) says: \"Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus\" Once I started thinking in the mindset of the charges of my sin being cancelled (instead of having to be repaid), it really made me think differently about asking for forgiveness. An example This example helped make it even more clear to me: Think of the number of times you have sinned in your life - your entire life. (in my case, I think it is a pretty big number) Now think of the number of sins you have confessed to God and asked for forgiveness. Are those 2 numbers the same? In my case, the first number was a lot bigger than the second number. When I pictured my debt to sin, I always pictured it like a monetary debt, where somehow the debt of my sins had to be paid. Asking God for forgiveness somehow paid that debt. However, in the context of the 2 numbers above, I was way behind in asking for forgiveness, and therefore still in debt. In the context of the verses I shared above, the debt is gone because Christ cancelled it! It's hard to understand because in our world, a debt has to be paid. The president couldn't go to all the mortgage companies and just tell them to cancel all the mortgages - someone would have to pay for it - the money has to come from somewhere. But it's different for God. He completely did away with our debt - it was gone the moment we asked him to save us. Another way to think about it: When Jesus died for my sins back 2000 years ago, how many sins had I committed then? Zero, because I wasn't even alive yet. By cancelling my charges 2000 years ago, there are no longer any charges of debt against the sins I commit today. That doesn't mean I don't ask for forgiveness though... Party like it's 1999? When I mention that all my sins were forgiven 2000 years ago and I'm \"all set\" once I ask Christ to save me, it sounds like a free pass to commit sins and be off the hook. To some extent, I think that may even be true: Good things can be abused. A small example, is those \"need a penny take a penny, have a penny give a penny\" things. That's a good thing, and it can help people from time to time. But someone could literally go to each of those things and take all the money out. That doesn't make those things bad - someone was just taking advantage of it. It's a very small-scale example, but it shows how something good is still good, even if people do bad things with it. However, if we are in an intimate relationship in-tune with God, we will feel remorse when we bring sin between us and God, and that is why we ask for forgiveness. Asking for forgiveness isn't to ensure our salvation on an ongoing basis. It is because we brought something bad into our relationship with God, and by confessing and asking for forgiveness, we make our relationship right again so we can remain close to Him. It's kind of like when one of our children is mean to the other child. The forgiveness part is to repair the relationship between the two of them. It's not like if they don't ask for forgiveness they would get kicked out of the family, or they wouldn't be siblings anymore. If one child was always mean to the other child and never asked for forgiveness and was never forgiven, that relationship probably wouldn't be good once they got older. It is about the mending of a relationship: If we are in a close relationship with God, we will want to confess and ask for forgiveness so we can be close again. What about ongoing sin? The only part about all of the above that is hard for me is the habitual sin. The \"cyclic\" sins - the ones where you sin, ask for forgiveness, and then find yourself in that same sin again. Here is my take on those: I believe that the feeling of remorse after sinning the same sin for the umpteenth time is the Holy Spirit reminding you that there is something between you and God. The fact that you ask for forgiveness is a sign that you want to make things right with God, and that you are growing in God. Keep on growing in God and asking for forgiveness. If it is a lifelong sin that you just can't beat, maybe try seeking a good Christian friend for accountability. I guess the point I am trying to make in this paragraph is that I believe when we were saved, Christ has already died for ALL of our sins, even when we keep committing them. Being forgiven of these habitual sins helps make our relationship closer to God. If you ever feel under attack from sins you have committed in the past, just know that Satan is the one who is reminding you of this, because God destroyed the whole system of debt to sin (like I mentioned above). You are no longer dead in your sins, but redeemed by the blood of Jesus! A song I really like the lyrics to the song \"Beautiful Things\" by Gungor. Here are the lyrics: All this pain I wonder if I'll ever find my way I wonder if my life could really change at all All this earth Could all that is lost ever be found Could a garden come up from this ground at all You make beautiful things You make beautiful things out of the dust You make beautiful things You make beautiful things out of us All around Hope is springing up from this old ground Out of chaos life is being found in You You make me new, You are making me new You make me new, You are making me new You are making me new Here is why I like this song: We were saved by God. He cancelled the charges of our sin. Only our Awesome God has the power to take us (when we can make such a mess of our lives) and make us innocent again. He has the power to actually take us back to innocence, like a newborn baby. He makes us new, as though we had never sinned. Wrapping up This note is super long, and I pray that God is somehow able to use my jumbled mess of words, and make them clear to you as you read it. I pray that maybe it can impact you like it is impacting me. It is like I don't live in fear of offending God anymore, but after I sin, I have the opportunity to make my relationship right with Him again. He loves us so much that He literally washed our sins away so we are as white as snow - innocent as a baby, like we have never sinned. He cast our sins as far as the East is from the West ( Psalm 103:12 ). How far is that? The Voyager 1 spacecraft from NASA is the farthest man-made object from Earth. It has been traveling away from Earth since 1977, and it is still traveling away from Earth at a speed of about 10 miles per second. It is more than 11,300,000,000 miles away (as of September 2012) from Earth and getting farther away all the time. AND, it is still inside our Galaxy (that just shows how small we are in the context of space). Imagine if NASA had released another spacecraft in the exact opposite direction - those two would be SUPER far away from each other. Imagine they travel away from each other for 1,000 years. That's not even a fraction of how far the east is from the west. That is how far God removed our sins from us. In other words - your sins are gone. Summary As a Christian - you are free from your sins, free from the charge of those sins, and in a relationship with the God who made you free. God wants to love us , not punish us. Once I started viewing God like this, it really started to change my relationship with Him, and maybe this email can help change your view of Him as well? Thanks for putting up with this long note.

Intro The topic is evangelism , and to be honest, as soon as I hear that word I feel: Afraid - afraid that I'm going to be led to go up to a stranger and witness to them Guilty - guilty because think of all the people around me that I haven't witnessed to - what if I was their only chance to become saved? It also makes me feel like I am making excuses, like: Not all people have the gift of evangelism, so for those of us that don't, our Christ-like example is the way we witness to others. That is probably true, but I still feel guilty, because what if I'm just using that as an excuse to avoid an awkward conversation with a stranger? What I have been learning recently, however, has taught me a new way to view evangelism. History of Evangelism To go back to the \"roots\" of God's intent to witness to the world, you can look to Genesis, at the life of Abraham. Around chapter 12, and many other chapters, Abraham is told that through his children, and their children, all nations will be reached. This of course refers to the nation of Israel. Genesis 12:3 says that all people and nations will be blessed through Abraham. The way that Israel was supposed to bless all nations was to live a different lifestyle than the nations around them, so that the other nations could see what it was like to live under God's blessings and protection. Unfortunately, Israel often got into the habit of making God exclusively theirs and trying to live completely cut-off from the world. Or, they would neglect God, and not live the different lifestyle that God called them to live, and became the same as the nations around them. Israel forgot that they were supposed to be priests that served the world, and instead they judged the world and tried to make God their own separate God. Then Jesus Came When Jesus came, he destroyed this old way, and made a new covenant not centered around a nation, but one that is available to every individual and calls us to love one another. Jesus made it clear that His love was to be shared with all, and not be made exclusive for any particular person or group. Galatians 3:16 (NASB) makes this pretty clear: \"Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, 'And to seeds,' as referring to many, but rather to one, 'And to your seed', that is, Christ.\" This verse confirms that Abraham's calling was directly looking forward to Jesus coming, but instead the Israelites took that to mean that God was only for them. How we fit in 1 Peter 2:9 says that we are a chosen race, a people for God's own possession, so that we may proclaim the Glory of Him who called us out of darkness and into His marvelous light. That means that all who have faith are the new Israel - all that was called of Israel is now called of us - we are to show the world how to live a different life to show others the effects of living under God. We often think of our salvation as a personal salvation - \"I am saved, so now I can go to heaven\". While this is true, we need to remember that we don't just exist for us but also for the world. We aren't just saved to save ourselves, but to save others as well. Our salvation isn't just for us, but for all of the world. What is evangelism, then? Evangelism isn't a calling to do something, but to be something. We evangelize by \"being\" - by showing the world what it is like to be loved by God - just like Israel was called to do. We are a part of God's family. We should live in a way that manifests the beautiful love of God. We become like Israel when we live separate from the world, or when we try to keep God to ourselves. It is convenient to live life in a closed circle, but there are people around us that are hungry with what we have. A Challenge So, I will put forth a challenge - and this is just as much a challenge to me: Pick one person that you think is a non-Christian, and pray for them every day. As you pray for them, be open to God leading you in ways to reveal His love to that person. It doesn't even have to involve a direct conversation with them (at first) - but can eventually turn into a relationship where they can be drawn into the family of God. Also - ask God to reveal one area of your life that blends in a little too much with the world. Summary To summarize: We have been made a part of the amazing family of God. We have the overwhelming, unfathomable love of God pouring on us. It is comfortable for us to hang out with this awesome family and never branch out to people not in our family, but we need to realize that there are people who see us and know that we have something special, and they would give anything to be a part of that family. Our call to evangelize is not to have scary confrontations with people, shoving the Bible down their throats. Our call to evangelize means that we need to show others the wonderful love of God that we have received. Once people become hungry for this love, it opens the door for a relationship with them - they will eventually become comfortable enough to talk about what life with Christ is like. Closing Evangelism should never involve forced, unnatural conversation, but letting someone feel the attraction of our \"family\" - that they are probably already hungry for.

As you pray for them, be open to God leading you in ways to reveal His love to that person. It doesn't even have to involve a direct conversation with them (at first) - but can eventually turn into a relationship where they can be drawn into the family of God. Also - ask God to reveal one area of your life that blends in a little too much with the world.","title":"A Challenge"},{"location":"random/2013-01-30-evangelism/#summary","text":"To summarize: We have been made a part of the amazing family of God. We have the overwhelming, unfathomable love of God pouring on us. It is comfortable for us to hang out with this awesome family and never branch out to people not in our family, but we need to realize that there are people who see us and know that we have something special, and they would give anything to be a part of that family. Our call to evangelize is not to have scary confrontations with people, shoving the Bible down their throats. Our call to evangelize means that we need to show others the wonderful love of God that we have received. Once people become hungry for this love, it opens the door for a relationship with them - they will eventually become comfortable enough to talk about what life with Christ is like.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"random/2013-01-30-evangelism/#closing","text":"Evangelism should never involve forced, unnatural conversation, but letting someone feel the attraction of our \"family\" - that they are probably already hungry for.

Predestination is one of those tough topics to understand, but I recently heard an example/analogy that helped me picture it a little easier. Train example The example relates predestination to a train. A train is \"predestined\" to go somewhere - meaning that someone planned out that, on a certain day, this train will travel from this city to that city with a number of stops on the way. A person can choose to board the train, and the moment they give their ticket and get on the train, they are now predestined to go where the train is going. Everything predestined for the train, is now predestined for that person. The person could choose to not board the train, and then would not be predestined to have what the train has to offer. That certainly doesn't mean that the person couldn't have chosen to board the train. Church example Another example is when our pastor prepares a sermon at church. It is predestined that anyone who comes to church will hear the message he prepared. If we choose to show up, we are predestined to hear that message. If we choose not to show up, we will not hear the message. That doesn't mean that our pastor picks and chooses who gets to hear the message - it means that we have the choice to hear the message, and once we choose to, we are hearing a message that we were predestined to hear. God I think (my opinion) that God knows all of the possible choices we could make, and if we choose one thing (to go to church, for example), our time at church will be what God predestined it to be. I honestly believe that God lets us make that choice to go, and we have the ability to choose not to go (instead of God planning out the exact path through life without us having the ability to make free will choices.) Anyways, I just wanted to share these 2 little examples because it really helped me picture predestination a little better. Day of Choices I was just about to send this note but I thought of another example: I'm at work, so I created this drawing pretty quick and sloppy, but hopefully it illustrates what I meant: Basically, the bottom of the drawing is when you wake up in the morning. You have a choice as soon as you wake up. It could be to snooze the alarm, or get up right away. It could be to make breakfast, or to get onto Facebook. I'm just making stuff up, but you get the idea. The dots on the picture show where there are choices to make. The green highlighted path is an example of how most of our days would end up - somewhere in the middle. But at the top of the picture, you can see the extreme range of possible ways you could end your day. It's true, that if you look at one of the dots, making one choice versus the other choice doesn't really affect you that much. If you look at the entire day, your choices really can cause some variance in your life. You could then make one of these pictures for a month of your life, a year of your life, and one for your entire lifetime. The range of possibilities would be massive. The point? My point in what I said above is that I believe that God sees the entire \"picture\" of your life before you were born, knows about all of those choices you can make, and knows the outcome of every choice. To tie it to predestination and the picture I drew: God predestined that picture for you, but I believe you got to choose your way through it (the green highlighted line). I really believe that we have the free will to choose a different path. In that sense, you are predestined for all of those paths, but you have the choice to go one way versus another. At the end of the day, the path you took was predestined for you, but had you chosen a different path, that way would have been predestined for you as well. Hopefully I didn't just muddy the waters by adding the picture :) God Bless!","title":"Predestination"},{"location":"random/2013-02-04-predestination/#predestination","text":"2/4/2013 I know we have talked about predestination a little bit in some of our meetings, specifically when we were in Romans.

I'd like to give another challenge - this one is a bit harder, but I've been doing it for a little while, and it is crazy how God uses it in your life. The challenge Here it is: Pray for an enemy. Maybe it's someone you work with that you can't stand, someone who rubs you the wrong way, someone who has hurt you, etc. If you don't have an enemy, pray for a national enemy. Maybe it's not even an enemy per se, but just someone you really don't like. Pray for that person every day - it doesn't even have to be a long prayer. Don't pray prayers that are trying to change them because that means you are still dwelling on how you don't like them. Simply: pray for blessings upon them. Pray that God would work in their life and their family's life. My person I knew right away who I was going to pray for, and at first, it stunk. But slowly, you start to view that person as another child of God, who has inexpressible worth and is deeply loved by God. Eventually, you start to change.

The sermon wasn't about prayer - it was about how we serve a God of the unexpected. Since it is near Christmas he was talking about the birth of Jesus and how the Jews were expecting their messiah to be a mighty warrior to deliver them from the Romans. Instead, he was born to a poor girl, visited by poor shepherds, and had nothing \"expected\" about Him. Nothing happened the way the Jews were praying and expecting it to happen. Towards the end of the sermon, he was saying to keep your eyes open for the unexpected. We use the phrase \"putting God in a box\" which is basically saying you expect God to do something a certain way... But we should know that he does things unexpected, so don't try to expect God to behave a certain way. The part that related to our prayer study was this: in our fallen state, we like to run things and control things our way. We feel secure when we are in charge. This is essentially trying to be lord of our own life. We need to cast our cares on Him, trusting that he will meet our needs. When we pray, we need to keep our eyes open for the unexpected . If we think we know how he is going to answer a prayer, we are probably going to miss the answer to the prayer. Pray with your eyes open to how God might surprise you. This reminded me of one of our earlier studies on praying along with God's will, and how sometimes we pray for what we want God's will to be.

From our study on love: Remember your name in Christ (I am a delight to God, I am God's handiwork, I am blameless before Christ, etc) What is the definition of love? Giving, sacrificing, ascribing worth to someone or something. How much does God love you? Think of what Jesus did for us on the cross - He couldn't have done more to show you how much he loves you! We aren't just receivers of God's love - we are to be \"conduits\" that let His love flow to others around us. The greatest commandment in the Bible: (Matthew 22:36-39) Love the Lord your God with all your heart AND love your neighbor as yourself. The greatest commandment in the Bible commands us to love others. ABOVE ALL - love 1 John 4:21 \"And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also.\" 1 Corinthians 16:14 \"Let all that you do be done in love.\" Colossians 3:14a \"Beyond all these things put on love\" 1 Peter 4:8 \"Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.\" Galatians 5:14 \"For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d\" Remember the thermostat/thermometer analogy? Our emotions are like a thermometer which goes up and down with our environment. Our love should be like a thermostat - we choose to set it (choose to love) and keep it there even when our environment is going up or down. Choose to love regardless of how you feel. Judgment - God is able to love people and judge people at the same time - we are not Unless someone has invited you to be in a deeper spiritual relationship with them, your only thought of that person should be how much God values that person (they were worth dying for!) and to love them. We are good at making excuses for our own mistakes, so why not cut people around you a little slack - only God knows the entire story of what that person is going through. Judgment is about ascribing worth to ourselves at cost to others. Love is about ascribing worth to others at cost to ourselves. The things listed above are good to try for, but remember, it comes out of the abundance of love that you are receiving from God. For that reason, we need to live in the center of God's love - Abide in His love - clothe yourself in His love. When you are living in His love, that love will pour out to those around you. From our study on 1 John: Keep in mind how timeless God's Word is - John walked and talked with Jesus, and then wrote (proclaimed) to the early church that they could have that same fellowship with Jesus - and so can we! John's message from Jesus: God is light, and cannot be around darkness. If we say we follow God but don't act like it, we walk in the darkness. If we say that we don't sin, the truth is not in us - however, if we confess our sins, he is faithful to forgive us of our sins. When we do sin, Jesus, the Righteous, is an advocate for us. If we say we abide in Jesus, we should act like Jesus One of the main points I took away from the first chapter of I John was that it is not about trying to walk in the light or trying not to sin - it is about abiding in God's love and as a result of your relationship with God, your actions will be more Christlike. It's the difference between trying to do everything you can to line your life up with God - versus - letting go, abiding in God, living in the center of Christ - and your actions will fall into place. Wrap up I think 2014 was a great year for our group - it's amazing to look back and see all the changes! I can't wait to see what God is going to do in 2015! Thanks everyone for your devotion to the group, for your prayers for each other, and for learning about God together as a group. I pray that God would bless each one of you this next year - that He will help us to grow stronger as a group, and that He will continue to put opportunities in each of our lives to love those around us.

I thought I would keep up the \"tradition\" of sending out a recap of our year as a small group at the end of each year. I like to look back across the year and remember what we studied together so hopefully this can be an encouragement to you. My feelings of 1 John I cannot believe we finished up our study in 1 John! We started studying it together in September of 2014 - that doesn't feel like that long ago... I feel that I am walking away from this study with a much greater appreciation for 1 John and a more meaningful understanding of the book - it has much more depth for me. 1 John recap In January we were in 1 John 2. God doesn't want us to sin, but when we do, He is our advocate and takes our sins (and not just ours, but the sins of the whole world!) John gave a sweet reminder (1 John 2:12-14) of how we have victory over sin. God commands us to love each other. John admonished to be separate from the world - to not love the things of this world. John uses the word abide (over and over) to encourage us to deepen our walks with God. This fall we covered 1 John 3-5. John reminded us of how God loves us like children - because we are His children! John re-emphasized the command that God gives us to love our brother. Jesus showed us the ultimate example of Love - He laid His life down for us. John cautioned us about listening to everyone who has an opinion - make sure you are verifying everything against the Bible with the help of the Holy Spirit John went into detail on how to know God more - by letting Him perfect His love in us. We love God because He first loved us. John yet again reminded us that we are commanded to love our brother. John gave his credentials to verify the authority he had in writing this letter. Remember from our study last year how we talked about 1 John being written towards the end of John's life, to give encouragement to a newer generation of Christ followers. John also explained that we can have confidence when we pray - whatever we ask according to God's will - God hears us. John finished up with this warning (the very last sentence of 1 John) - 1 John 5:21 - \"Little children, guard yourselves from idols.\" Looking ahead I feel that John's last sentence of 1 John is very important. He chose to end his letter not with a formal closing, but a warning to guard yourselves from idols. I think this is a perfect segue into our upcoming study of the beatitudes. Just keep that last verse of 1 John in mind as we go into our next study. In fact, from now until the time we meet again, I would like to challenge you to think of an idol in your life. What takes your time away from spending time with God. Or - what are you getting your life from when you should be getting your life from God... Reflect on that as we go into our next study. Wrap up This past year was another great year for our group. I feel that we have all grown much stronger in our abilities to study the Bible. I encourage you to continue to study the Bible on your own - on a regular basis. That is how you feed yourself spiritually. I am so pumped to be a part of this small group. I truly believe God has great things in store for our group and I'm excited to grow along with all of you. Thank you all for the dedication towards this group and being willing to invest your family's time in this small group. Thank you for how you reach out to each other in times of need, encourage each other, have fun with each other - it is a huge blessing to me. I continue to pray that God blesses each of you, that God will be made real to you, and that your relationship with God will grow deeper than ever before.

God doesn't want us to sin, but when we do, He is our advocate and takes our sins (and not just ours, but the sins of the whole world!) John gave a sweet reminder (1 John 2:12-14) of how we have victory over sin. God commands us to love each other. John admonished to be separate from the world - to not love the things of this world. John uses the word abide (over and over) to encourage us to deepen our walks with God. This fall we covered 1 John 3-5. John reminded us of how God loves us like children - because we are His children! John re-emphasized the command that God gives us to love our brother. Jesus showed us the ultimate example of Love - He laid His life down for us. John cautioned us about listening to everyone who has an opinion - make sure you are verifying everything against the Bible with the help of the Holy Spirit John went into detail on how to know God more - by letting Him perfect His love in us. We love God because He first loved us. John yet again reminded us that we are commanded to love our brother. John gave his credentials to verify the authority he had in writing this letter. Remember from our study last year how we talked about 1 John being written towards the end of John's life, to give encouragement to a newer generation of Christ followers. John also explained that we can have confidence when we pray - whatever we ask according to God's will - God hears us. John finished up with this warning (the very last sentence of 1 John) - 1 John 5:21 - \"Little children, guard yourselves from idols.\"","title":"1 John recap"},{"location":"random/2015-12-31-2015-recap/#looking-ahead","text":"I feel that John's last sentence of 1 John is very important.

Jeremiah 9:23-24 (NLT): This is what the Lord says: \u201cDon\u2019t let the wise boast in their wisdom, or the powerful boast in their power, or the rich boast in their riches. But those who wish to boast should boast in this alone: that they truly know me and understand that I am the Lord who demonstrates unfailing love and who brings justice and righteousness to the earth, and that I delight in these things. I, the Lord, have spoken! Commitment Commitment to Abide: Get your source from the Vine and just be the branch: \u201cRest harder not work harder\u201d - Jefferson Bethke Challenge to not eat food for the day until she had eaten food for her soul Make relationship with God intentional like a marriage (don't just spend a few minutes a day and an hour on Sundays) Make God the ultimate goal - and only God. Make God the treasure - become the treasure hunter Make God the first in your life: \u201cPut first things first and we get second things thrown in: put second things first and we lose both first and second things.\u201d - C.S.

Jesus prayed for you ! A quote from my mom: The only thing that made a difference for me was spending time sitting with God and His Word. It started out as gaining information. Just reading and realizing how little I knew. Each day I would spend more and more time, reading and listening. Being convicted and confessing my sin. I regret wasting so much of my life not \u201cknowing\u201d God. There is so little time left and so much of God\u2019s love to give away. How can you know someone if the only spend five minutes a day and an hour on Sundays? As I read and spent time with the Lord a natural desire to dig deeper rose up in me. Studying words or reading for long periods of time. I just was so thirsty for Him. My love and delight in Him grew and still grows. Each day is an adventure or a struggle depending on what God is working out in my life. List of important things to help in becoming a \"treasure hunter\" READ the Bible EVERY Day (We are prone to wander and need food daily) Read books that help you understand the Bible Read books that challenge you Read with other believers Pay attention to how you hear the Word. Luke chapter 8 is a great chapter! Parable of the Farmer and Scatter of the seed, parable of the lamp. Verse 18: \u201cSo pay attention to how you hear. To those who listen to my teaching more understanding will be given.\u201d Stand on His promises. How can you know His promises if you don\u2019t READ.

(He will Never leave you, He will hold you close Ps. 27, He is our home Ps. 90, He is with us, He will never fail us, He will never lie, He tells the truth always\u2026.)

(John 13-17) Especially John 17:20 Search for yourself. Sermons and books are great, but finding a Truth that God has given you is great growth in your love relationship with Him. Find that nugget of Truth, own it, grow in it and then give it away! Don\u2019t wait to Abide in Him. Sell everything you have if you have to. Get up at 2:00 am if you have to.

Thanks for the openness during our discussion last night - let's be diligent in loving the people around us! I wanted to follow up on something I shared last night about our prayer time in group. Going into the fall I had been thinking and praying a lot about our prayer time on Sunday nights, and through a variety of ways, God helped me refine my vision for how we pray together as a group. Let me start with this: All prayer is important, and there aren't any prayer requests that are too small to pray about . We learned so much during our study on prayer and if anything we want to pray more! I will also admit that as I shared this last night and as I write this email, I am a little self-conscious that my words will be taken the wrong way. I am praying as I send this email that God would make my words clear. If my words aren't clear, please talk to me or Emily so we can clarify :) What this email isn't This email is not about discouraging prayer. This email is not about \"cracking down\" on our past prayer time. This email is not about praying less. This email is not about discouraging people from having prayer requests. What this email is This email is about focusing our prayer time so we can lift each other up more. This email is about shifting prayer for extended people to outside our normal small group prayer time. This email is about 1 Thessalonians 5:11 - \"So encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing.\" This email is about encouraging you to examine your personal life and the lives of your kids and asking your fellow group members to strengthen you in prayer. During Small Group Prayer Time My thoughts for our group prayer time center around building each other up and focusing on how we can pray specifically for the members in our group. I would like to encourage us to think of how our small group can pray for our immediate group and try not to branch out to praying for extended family or friends during our Sunday night prayer time. This may sound like I don't think we should pray for those requests, but that is not what I think. We should pray more for those type of requests (see the next section), but I am seeing value in focusing the limited time we have during our Sunday night prayer time to lift up each another. The drive for this change comes from the depths of my heart - because I love this group and want us to strengthen each other. I think a great way to help strengthen each other is to pray for each other. Caveats I am also not saying we should never pray for extended family/friends on a Sunday night - I think there will be exceptions. But as you think about what you would like the group to pray for, try to focus the request so that we can pray for you , and not a person the rest of the group probably doesn't know. I think if a request for extended family/friends needs a lot of detail and explaining, it might be easier to share that through email instead of during group prayer time. Final thoughts I also wanted to clarify that this is not about adding rules for us to follow (like we learned last night, it's not about the rules!) This is more of refocusing to make the most out of the time we have for prayer together as a group. God bless you guys - I hope your next 3 weeks until we meet are filled with the Holy Spirit!","title":"Refocus Prayer email"},{"location":"random/2016-10-10-refoucs-prayer-email/#small-group-email-on-prayer","text":"Hey everyone, I am so thankful for this group - we had an amazing discussion last night and I feel God was really calling us to take action on what we learned.
